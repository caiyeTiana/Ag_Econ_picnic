          "abstract": "The widespread use of video games has raised concerns about their potential negative impact on mental well-being. Nevertheless, the empirical evidence supporting this notion is largely based on correlational studies, warranting further investigation into the causal relationship. Here we identify the causal effect of video gaming on mental well-being in Japan (2020–2022) using game console lotteries as a natural experiment. Employing approaches designed for causal inference on survey data ( n = 97,602), we found that game console ownership, along with increased game play, improved mental well-being. The console ownership reduced psychological distress and improved life satisfaction by 0.1–0.6 standard deviations. Furthermore, a causal forest machine learning algorithm revealed divergent impacts between different types of console, with one showing smaller benefits for adolescents and females while the other showed larger benefits for adolescents.

          "authors": "Ashley E. Martin, Diego Guevara Beltran, Jeremy Koster, Jessica L. Tracy",
          "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that gender is a defining feature of personhood. Studies show that gender is the primary social category individuals use to perceive humanness and the social category most strongly related to seeing someone—or something—as human. However, the universality of gender’s primacy in social perception and its precedence over other social categories like race and age have been debated. We examined the primacy of gender perception in the Mayangna community of Nicaragua, a population with minimal exposure to Western influences, to test whether the primacy of gender categorization in humanization is more likely to be a culturally specific construct or a cross-cultural and potentially universal phenomenon. Consistent with findings from North American populations [A. E. Martin, M. F. Mason, J. Pers. Soc. Psychol. 123, 292–315 (2022)], the Mayangna ascribed gender to nonhuman objects more strongly than any other social category—including age, race, sexual orientation, disability, and religion—and gender was the only social category that uniquely predicted perceived humanness (i.e., the extent to which a nonhuman entity was seen as “human”). This pattern persisted even in the most isolated subgroup of the sample, who had no exposure to Western culture or media. The present results thus suggest that gender’s primacy in social cognition is a widely generalizable, and potentially universal, phenomenon.",

          "abstract": "Whereas principles of communicative efficiency and legal doctrine dictate that laws be comprehensible to the common world, empirical evidence suggests legal documents are largely incomprehensible to lawyers and laypeople alike. Here, a corpus analysis ( n = 59) million words) first replicated and extended prior work revealing laws to contain strikingly higher rates of complex syntactic structures relative to six baseline genres of English. Next, two preregistered text generation experiments ( n = 286) tested two leading hypotheses regarding how these complex structures enter into legal documents in the first place. In line with the magic spell hypothesis , we found people tasked with writing official laws wrote in a more convoluted manner than when tasked with writing unofficial legal texts of equivalent conceptual complexity. Contrary to the copy-and-edit hypothesis, we did not find evidence that people editing a legal document wrote in a more convoluted manner than when writing the same document from scratch. From a cognitive perspective, these results suggest law to be a rare exception to the general tendency in human language toward communicative efficiency. In particular, these findings indicate law’s complexity to be derived from its performativity, whereby low-frequency structures may be inserted to signal law’s authoritative, world-state-altering nature, at the cost of increased processing demands on readers. From a law and policy perspective, these results suggest that the tension between the ubiquity and impenetrability of the law is not an inherent one, and that laws can be simplified without a loss or distortion of communicative content.",

Compromised lysosomal degradation is a hallmark of many degenerative diseases, including lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs), which are caused by loss-of-function mutations within both alleles of a lysosomal hydrolase, leading to lysosomal substrate accumulation. Gaucher’s disease, characterized by &lt;15% of normal glucocerebrosidase function, is the most common LSD and is a prominent risk factor for developing Parkinson’s disease. Here, we show that either of two structurally distinct small molecules that modulate PIKfyve activity, identified in a high-throughput cellular lipid droplet clearance screen, can improve glucocerebrosidase function in Gaucher patient–derived fibroblasts through an MiT/TFE transcription factor that promotes lysosomal gene translation. An integrated stress response (ISR) antagonist used in combination with a PIKfyve modulator further improves cellular glucocerebrosidase activity, likely because ISR signaling appears to also be slightly activated by treatment by either small molecule at the higher doses employed. This strategy of combining a PIKfyve modulator with an ISR inhibitor improves mutant lysosomal hydrolase function in cellular models of additional LSD.",

The siliceous diatom frustule is often assumed to have coevolved with the silica-lined teeth of copepods, but empirical evidence of how this relationship drives natural selection and evolution is still lacking. Here, we show that feeding on diatoms causes significant wear and tear on copepod teeth and that this leads to copepods becoming selective feeders. Teeth from copepods feeding on thick-shelled diatoms were more likely to be broken or cracked than those feeding on a dinoflagellate. When fed a large diatom, all analyzed teeth had visible wear. Our results underscore the importance of the predator–prey arms race as a driving force in planktonic evolution and diversity.",

Here, to improve the ability of red blood cells (RBCs) for normothermic machine perfusion, a biocompatible blood silicification approach termed “shielding-augmenting RBC-in-nanoscale amorphous silica (SARNAS)” has been developed. The key to RBC surface engineering and structure augmentation is the precise control of the hydrolysis form of silicic acid to realize stabilization of RBC within conformal nanoscale silica-based exoskeletons. The formed silicified RBCs (Si-RBCs) maintain membrane/structural integrity, normal cellular functions (e.g., metabolism, oxygen-carrying capability), and enhance resistance to external stressors as well as tunable mechanical properties, resulting in nearly 100% RBC cryoprotection. In vivo experiments confirm their excellent biocompatibility. By shielding RBC surface antigens, the Si-RBCs provide universal blood compatibility, the ability for allogeneic mechanical perfusion, and more importantly, the possibility for cross-species transfusion. Being simple, reliable, and easily scalable, the SARNAS strategy holds great promise to revolutionize the use of engineered blood for future clinical applications.",

          "abstract": "The southeastward extrusion of Indochina along the Ailao Shan–Red River shear zone (ARSZ) is one of two of the most prominent consequences of the India–Asia collision. This plate-scale extrusion has greatly changed Southeast Asian topography and drainage patterns and effected regional climate and biotic evolution. However, little is known about how Indochina was extruded toward the southeast over time. Here, we sampled 42 plant and animal clades (together encompassing 1,721 species) that are distributed across the ARSZ and are not expected to disperse across long distances. We first assess the possible role of climate on driving the phylogenetic separations observed across the ARSZ. We then investigate the temporal dynamics of the extrusion of Indochina through a multitaxon analysis. We show that the lineage divergences across the ARSZ were most likely associated with the Indochinese extrusion rather than climatic events. The lineage divergences began at ~53 Ma and increased sharply ~35 Ma, with two peaks at ~19 Ma and ~7 Ma, and one valley at ~13 Ma. Our results suggest a two-phase model for the extrusion of Indochina, and in each phase, the extrusion was subject to periods of acceleration and decrease, in agreement with the changes of the India–Asia convergence rate and angle from the early Eocene to the late Miocene. This study highlights that a multitaxon analysis can illuminate the timing of subtle historical events that may be difficult for geological data to pinpoint and can be used to explore other tectonic events.",

          "abstract": "2’-deoxy-ATP (dATP) improves cardiac function by increasing the rate of crossbridge cycling and Ca 2 + transient decay. However, the mechanisms of these effects and how therapeutic responses to dATP are achieved when dATP is only a small fraction of the total ATP pool remain poorly understood. Here, we used a multiscale computational modeling approach to analyze the mechanisms by which dATP improves ventricular function. We integrated atomistic simulations of prepowerstroke myosin and actomyosin association, filament-scale Markov state modeling of sarcomere mechanics, cell-scale analysis of myocyte Ca 2 + dynamics and contraction, organ-scale modeling of biventricular mechanoenergetics, and systems level modeling of circulatory dynamics. Molecular and Brownian dynamics simulations showed that dATP increases the actomyosin association rate by 1.9 fold. Markov state models predicted that dATP increases the pool of myosin heads available for crossbridge cycling, increasing steady-state force development at low dATP fractions by 1.3 fold due to mechanosensing and nearest-neighbor cooperativity. This was found to be the dominant mechanism by which small amounts of dATP can improve contractile function at myofilament to organ scales. Together with faster myocyte Ca 2 + handling, this led to improved ventricular contractility, especially in a failing heart model in which dATP increased ejection fraction by 16% and the energy efficiency of cardiac contraction by 1%. This work represents a complete multiscale model analysis of a small molecule myosin modulator from single molecule to organ system biophysics and elucidates how the molecular mechanisms of dATP may improve cardiovascular function in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.",

WDR5 is tethered to chromatin via an arginine-binding cavity known as the “WIN” site. Multiple pharmacological inhibitors of the WDR5-interaction site of WDR5 (WINi) have been described, including those with picomolar affinity and oral bioavailability in mice. Thus far, however, WINi have only been shown to be effective against a number of rare cancer types retaining wild-type p53. To explore the full potential of WINi for cancer therapy, we systematically profiled WINi across a panel of cancer cells, alone and in combination with other agents. We report that WINi are unexpectedly active against cells derived from both solid and blood-borne cancers, including those with mutant p53. Among hematologic malignancies, we find that WINi are effective as a single agent against leukemia and diffuse large B cell lymphoma xenograft models, and can be combined with the approved drug venetoclax to suppress disseminated acute myeloid leukemia in vivo. These studies reveal actionable strategies for the application of WINi to treat blood-borne cancers and forecast expanded utility of WINi against other cancer types.",

          "abstract": "Clean production of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) with water, oxygen, and renewable energy is considered an important green synthesis route, offering a valuable substitute for the traditional anthraquinone method. Currently, renewable energy–driven production of H 2 O 2 mostly relies on soluble additives, such as electrolytes and sacrificial agents, inevitably compromising the purity and sustainability of H 2 O 2 . Herein, we develop a solution plasma catalysis technique that eliminates the need for soluble additives, enabling eco-friendly production of concentrated H 2 O 2 directly from water and O 2 . Screening over 40 catalysts demonstrates the superior catalytic performance of carbon nitride interacting with discharge plasma in water. High-throughput density functional theory calculations for 68 models, along with machine learning using 29 descriptors, identify cyano carbon nitride (CCN) as the most efficient catalyst. Solution plasma catalysis with the CCN achieves concentrated H 2 O 2 of 20 mmol L −1 , two orders of magnitude higher than photocatalysis by the same catalyst. Plasma diagnostics, isotope labeling, and COMSOL simulations collectively validate that the interplay of solution plasma and the CCN accounts for the significantly increased production of singlet oxygen and H 2 O 2 thereafter. Our findings offer an efficient and sustainable pathway for H 2 O 2 production, promising wide-ranging applications across the chemical industry, public health, and environmental remediation.",

          "abstract": "Most bacteria are surrounded by a cell wall that contains peptidoglycan (PG), a large polymer composed of glycan strands held together by short peptide cross-links. There are two major types of cross-links, termed 4-3 and 3-3 based on the amino acids involved. 4-3 cross-links are created by penicillin-binding proteins, while 3-3 cross-links are created by L , D -transpeptidases (LDTs). In most bacteria, the predominant mode of cross-linking is 4-3, and these cross-links are essential for viability, while 3-3 cross-links comprise only a minor fraction and are not essential. However, in the opportunistic intestinal pathogen Clostridioides difficile, about 70% of the cross-links are 3-3. We show here that 3-3 cross-links and LDTs are essential for viability in C. difficile . We also show that C. difficile has five LDTs, three with a YkuD catalytic domain as in all previously known LDTs and two with a VanW catalytic domain, whose function was until now unknown. The five LDTs exhibit extensive functional redundancy. VanW domain proteins are found in many gram-positive bacteria but scarce in other lineages. We tested seven non– C. difficile VanW domain proteins and confirmed LDT activity in three cases. In summary, our findings uncover a previously unrecognized family of PG cross-linking enzymes, assign a catalytic function to VanW domains, and demonstrate that 3-3 cross-linking is essential for viability in C. difficile , the first time this has been shown in any bacterial species. The essentiality of LDTs in C. difficile makes them potential targets for antibiotics that kill C. difficile selectively.",

Individuals with ASTN2 mutations exhibit neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), learning difficulties, and language delay. To provide a genetic model for the role of the cerebellum in ASD-related behaviors and study the role of ASTN2 in cerebellar circuit function, we generated global and PC-specific conditional Astn2 knockout (KO and cKO, respectively) mouse lines. Astn2 KO mice exhibit strong ASD-related behavioral phenotypes, including a marked decrease in separation-induced pup ultrasonic vocalization calls, hyperactivity, repetitive behaviors, altered behavior in the three-chamber test, and impaired cerebellar-dependent eyeblink conditioning. Hyperactivity and repetitive behaviors are also prominent in Astn2 cKO animals, but they do not show altered behavior in the three-chamber test. By Golgi staining, Astn2 KO PCs have region-specific changes in dendritic spine density and filopodia numbers. Proteomic analysis of Astn2 KO cerebellum reveals a marked upregulation of ASTN2 family member, ASTN1, a neuron–glial adhesion protein. Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy demonstrate a significant increase in Bergmann glia volume in the molecular layer of Astn2 KO animals. Electrophysiological experiments indicate a reduced frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), as well as increased amplitudes of both spontaneous EPSCs and inhibitory postsynaptic currents in the Astn2 KO animals, suggesting that pre- and postsynaptic components of synaptic transmission are altered. Thus, ASTN2 regulates ASD-like behaviors and cerebellar circuit properties.",

          "abstract": "Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are major vectors of dengue, chikungunya, and other arboviral diseases. Ae. aegypti ’s capacity to reproduce and to spread disease depends on the female mosquitoes’ ability to obtain blood meals and find water-filled containers in which to lay eggs (oviposit). While humidity sensation (hygrosensation) has been implicated in these behaviors, the specific hygrosensory pathways involved have been unclear. Here, we establish the distinct molecular requirements and anatomical locations of Ae. aegypti Dry Cells and Moist Cells and examine their contributions to behavior. We show that Dry Cell and Moist Cell responses to humidity involve different ionotropic receptor (IR) family sensory receptors, with dry air-activated Dry Cells reliant upon the IR Ir40a , and humid air-activated Moist Cells upon Ir68a . Both classes of hygrosensors innervate multiple antennal sensilla, including sensilla ampullacea near the antennal base as well as two classes of coeloconic sensilla near the tip. Dry Cells and Moist Cells each support behaviors linked to mosquito reproduction but contribute differently: Ir40a -dependent Dry Cells act in parallel with Ir68a -dependent Moist Cells to promote blood feeding, while oviposition site seeking is driven specifically by Ir68a- dependent Moist Cells. Together these findings reveal the importance of distinct hygrosensory pathways in blood feeding and oviposition site seeking and suggest Ir40a- dependent Dry Cells and Ir68a- dependent Moist Cells as potential targets for vector control strategies.",

          "abstract": "Firmly anchored on observational data, giant radio lobes from massive galaxies hosting supermassive black holes can exert a major negative feedback effect, by endowing the intergalactic gas with significant magnetic pressure hence retarding or preventing gas accretion onto less massive halos in the vicinity. Since massive galaxies that are largely responsible for producing the giant radio lobes, this effect is expected to be stronger in more overdense large-scale environments, such as protoclusters, than in underdense regions, such as voids. We show that by redshift z = 2 halos with masses up to ( 10 11 to 12 , 10 12 to 13 ) M ⊙ are significantly hindered from accreting gas due to this effect for radio bubble volume filling fraction of ( 1.0 , 0.2 ) , respectively. Since the vast majority of the stars in the universe at z &lt; 2 to 3 form precisely in those halos, this negative feedback process is likely one major culprit for causing the global downturn in star formation in the universe. It also provides a natural explanation for the rather sudden flattening of the slope of the galaxy rest-frame UV luminosity function around z ∼ 2 . A cross-correlation between protoclusters and Faraday rotation measures may test the predicted magnetic field.

          "abstract": "Estuaries, as connectors between land and ocean, have complex interactions of river and tidal flows that affect the transport of buoyant materials like floating plastics, oil spills, organic matter, and larvae. This study investigates surface-trapped buoyant particle transport in estuaries by using idealized and realistic numerical simulations along with a theoretical model. While river discharge and estuarine exchange flow are usually expected to export buoyant particles to the ocean over subtidal timescales, this study reveals a ubiquitous physical transport mechanism that causes retention of buoyant particles in estuaries. Tidally varying surface convergence fronts affect the aggregation of buoyant particles, and the coupling between particle aggregation and oscillatory tidal currents leads to landward transport at subtidal timescales. Landward transport and retention of buoyant particles is greater in small estuaries, while large estuaries tend to export buoyant particles to the ocean. A dimensionless width parameter incorporating the tidal radian frequency and lateral velocity distinguishes small and large estuaries at a transitional value of around 1. Additionally, higher river flow tends to shift estuaries toward seaward transport and export of buoyant particles. These findings provide insights into understanding the distribution of buoyant materials in estuaries and predicting their fate in the land–sea exchange processes.",

Illustrative of this, there is not yet a discrete biological role assigned for one of the most highly conserved modifications, 5-methyluridine at position 54 in tRNAs (m 5 U54). Here, we uncover contributions of m 5 U54 to both tRNA maturation and protein synthesis. Our mass spectrometry analyses demonstrate that cells lacking the enzyme that installs m 5 U in the T-loop (TrmA in Escherichia coli , Trm2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) exhibit altered tRNA modification patterns. Furthermore, m 5 U54-deficient tRNAs are desensitized to small molecules that prevent translocation in vitro. This finding is consistent with our observations that relative to wild-type cells, trm2Δ cell growth and transcriptome-wide gene expression are less perturbed by translocation inhibitors. Together our data suggest a model in which m 5 U54 acts as an important modulator of tRNA maturation and translocation of the ribosome during protein synthesis.",

          "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that altered myelination is an important pathophysiologic correlate of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer and Parkinson’s diseases. Thus, improving myelin integrity may be an effective intervention to prevent and treat age-associated neurodegenerative pathologies. It has been suggested that cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) may preserve and enhance cerebral myelination throughout the adult lifespan, but this hypothesis has not been fully tested. Among cognitively normal participants from two well-characterized studies spanning a wide age range, we assessed CRF operationalized as the maximum rate of oxygen consumption (VO 2 max) and myelin content defined by myelin water fraction (MWF) estimated through our advanced multicomponent relaxometry MRI method. We found significant positive correlations between VO 2 max and MWF across several white matter regions. Interestingly, the effect size of this association was higher in brain regions susceptible to early degeneration, including the frontal lobes and major white matter fiber tracts. Further, the interaction between age and VO 2 max exhibited i) a steeper positive slope in the older age group, suggesting that the association of VO 2 max with MWF is stronger at middle and older ages and ii) a steeper negative slope in the lower VO 2 max group, indicating that lower VO 2 max levels are associated with lower myelination with increasing age. Finally, the nonlinear pattern of myelin maturation and decline is VO 2 max-dependent with the higher VO 2 max group reaching the MWF peak at later ages. This study provides evidence of an interconnection between CRF and cerebral myelination and suggests therapeutic strategies for promoting brain health and attenuating white matter degeneration.",

          "abstract": "Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a rare and most often severe genetic disease characterized by recurrent blistering and erosions of the skin and mucous membranes after minor trauma, leading to major local and systemic complications. The disease is caused by loss-of-function variants in COL7A1 encoding type VII collagen (C7), the main component of anchoring fibrils, which form attachment structures stabilizing the cutaneous basement membrane zone. Alterations in C7 protein structure and/or expression lead to abnormal, rare or absent anchoring fibrils resulting in loss of dermal-epidermal adherence and skin blistering. To date, more than 1,200 distinct COL7A1 deleterious variants have been reported and 19% are splice variants. Here, we describe two RDEB patients for whom we identified two pathogenic deep intronic pathogenic variants in COL7A1 . One of these variants (c.7795-97C &gt; G) promotes the inclusion of a pseudoexon between exons 104 and 105 in the COL7A1 transcript, while the other causes partial or complete retention of intron 51. We used antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) mediated exon skipping to correct these aberrant splicing events in vitro. This led to increased normal mRNA splicing above 94% and restoration of C7 protein expression at a level (up to 56%) that should be sufficient to reverse the phenotype. This first report of exon skipping applied to counteract deep intronic variants in COL7A1 represents a promising therapeutic strategy for personalized medicine directed at patients with intronic variants at a distance of consensus splice sites.",

This behavior can be investigated by probing the scattering rate of electrons in a broad class of materials often referred to as “strongly correlated metals”. It is clear that in some cases only electron–electron scattering can be its cause, while in others it arises from high-temperature scattering of electrons from quantized lattice vibrations, i.e., phonons. In metallic oxides, which are among the most studied materials, analysis of electrical transport does not satisfactorily identify the relevant scattering mechanism at “high” temperatures near room temperature. We therefore employ a contactless optical method to measure thermal diffusivity in two Ru-based layered perovskites, Sr 3 Ru 2 O 7 and Sr 2 RuO 4 , and use the measurements to extract the dimensionless Lorenz ratio. By comparing our results to the literature data on both conventional and unconventional metals, we show how the analysis of high-temperature thermal transport can both give important insight into dominant scattering mechanisms and be offered as a stringent test of theories attempting to explain anomalous scattering.",

          "abstract": "Upon DNA damage, numerous proteins are targeted for ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation, which is an integral part of the DNA repair program. Although details of the ubiquitination processes have been intensively studied, little is known about whether and how the 26S proteasome is regulated in the DNA damage response (DDR). Here, we show that human Rpn10/PSMD4, one of the three ubiquitin receptors of the 26S proteasome, is rapidly phosphorylated in response to different types of DNA damage. The phosphorylation occurs at Rpn10-Ser266 within a conserved SQ motif recognized by ATM/ATR/DNA-PK. Blockade of S266 phosphorylation attenuates homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair and sensitizes cells to genotoxic insults. In vitro and in cellulo experiments indicate that phosphorylation of S266, located in the flexible linker between the two ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) of Rpn10, alters the configuration of UIMs, and actually reduces ubiquitin chain (substrate) binding. As a result, essential DDR proteins such as BRCA1 are spared from premature degradation and allowed sufficient time to engage in DNA repair, a scenario supported by proximity labeling and quantitative proteomic studies. These findings reveal an inherent self-limiting mechanism of the proteasome that, by controlling substrate recognition through Rpn10 phosphorylation, fine-tunes protein degradation for optimal responses under stress.",

Here, we compiled the comprehensive global dataset and employed machine learning approaches to refine our quantitative understanding of MDC contributions to total carbon storage. Our efforts resulted in a reduction in the relative standard errors in prevailing estimations by an average of 71% and minimized the effect of global variations in bacterial group compositions on estimating MDC. Our estimation indicates that MDC contributes approximately 758 Pg, representing approximately 40% of the global soil carbon stock.

          "abstract": "The emergence of carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-hvKp) is a growing concern due to its high mortality and limited treatment options. Although hypermucoviscosity is crucial for CR-hvKp infection, the role of changes in bacterial mucoviscosity in the host colonization and persistence of CR-hvKp is not clearly defined. Herein, we observed a phenotypic switch of CR-hvKp from a hypermucoviscous to a hypomucoviscous state in a patient with scrotal abscess and urinary tract infection (UTI). This switch was attributed to decreased expression of rmpADC , the regulator of mucoid phenotype, caused by deletion of the upstream insertion sequence IS Kpn26 . Postswitching, the hypomucoid variant showed a 9.0-fold decrease in mice sepsis mortality, a &gt;170.0-fold reduction in the ability to evade macrophage phagocytosis in vitro, and an 11.2- to 40.9-fold drop in growth rate in normal mouse serum. Conversely, it exhibited an increased residence time in the mouse urinary tract (21 vs. 6 d), as well as a 216.4-fold boost in adhesion to bladder epithelial cells and a 48.7% enhancement in biofilm production. Notably, the CR-hvKp mucoid switch was reproduced in an antibiotic-free mouse UTI model. The in vivo generation of hypomucoid variants was primarily associated with defective or low expression of rmpADC or capsule synthesis gene wcaJ , mediated by IS Kpn26 insertion/deletion or base-pair insertion. The spontaneous hypomucoid variants also outcompeted hypermucoid bacteria in the mouse urinary tract. Collectively, the IS Kpn26 -associated mucoid switch in CR-hvKp signifies the antibiotic-independent host adaptive evolution, providing insights into the role of mucoid switch in the persistence of CR-hvKp.",

Using cryo-electron microscopy, we determined the structures of these molecules when bound to the fibrils formed by E46K mutant α-syn and compared them to those bound with wild-type α-syn fibrils.

Attention may enhance visual perception by reducing shared spiking variability. However, shared variability and its attentional modulation are not consistent within or across cortical areas, and depend on additional factors such as neuronal type. A critical factor that has not been tested is actual anatomical connectivity. We measured spike count correlations among pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) for which anatomical connectivity was inferred from spiking cross-correlations. Neurons were recorded in monkeys performing a contrast-change discrimination task requiring covert shifts in visual spatial attention. Accordingly, spike count correlations were compared across trials in which attention was directed toward or away from the visual stimulus overlapping recorded neuronal receptive fields. Consistent with prior findings, attention did not significantly alter spike count correlations among random pairings of unconnected V1 neurons. However, V1 neurons connected via excitatory synapses showed a significant reduction in spike count correlations with attention. Interestingly, V1 neurons connected via inhibitory synapses demonstrated high spike count correlations overall that were not modulated by attention. Correlated variability in excitatory circuits also depended upon neuronal tuning for contrast, the task-relevant stimulus feature. These results indicate that shared variability depends on the type of connectivity in neuronal circuits. Also, attention significantly reduces shared variability in excitatory circuits, even when attention effects on randomly sampled neurons within the same area are weak.",

          "abstract": "Breast Cancer Type 1 Susceptibility Protein (BRCA1) is a tumor-suppressor protein that regulates various cellular pathways, including those that are essential for preserving genome stability. One essential mechanism involves a BRCA1-A complex that is recruited to double-strand breaks (DSBs) by RAP80 before initiating DNA damage repair (DDR). How RAP80 itself is recruited to DNA damage sites, however, is unclear. Here, we demonstrate an intrinsic correlation between a methyltransferase DOT1L-mediated RAP80 methylation and BRCA1-A complex chromatin recruitment that occurs during cancer cell radiotherapy resistance. Mechanistically, DOT1L is quickly recruited onto chromatin and methylates RAP80 at multiple lysines in response to DNA damage. Methylated RAP80 is then indispensable for binding to ubiquitinated H2A and subsequently triggering BRCA1-A complex recruitment onto DSBs. Importantly, DOT1L-catalyzed RAP80 methylation and recruitment of BRCA1 have clinical relevance, as inhibition of DOT1L or RAP80 methylation seems to enhance the radiosensitivity of cancer cells both in vivo and in vitro. These data reveal a crucial role for DOT1L in DDR through initiating recruitment of RAP80 and BRCA1 onto chromatin and underscore a therapeutic strategy based on targeting DOT1L to overcome tumor radiotherapy resistance.",

Positron emission tomography brain imaging using the radiotracer [ 11 C]PBR28 was used to measure the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), a microglial marker, at baseline and 3 h after administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent immune activator. Data were acquired in 15 individuals with PTSD and 15 age-matched controls. The PTSD group exhibited a significantly lower magnitude LPS-induced increase in TSPO availability in an a priori prefrontal-limbic circuit compared to controls. Greater anhedonic symptoms in the PTSD group were associated with a more suppressed neuroimmune response. In addition, while a reduced granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor response to LPS was observed in the PTSD group, other measured cytokine responses and self-reported sickness symptoms did not differ between groups; these findings highlight group differences in central–peripheral immune system relationships. The results of this study provide evidence of a suppressed microglia-mediated neuroimmune response to a direct immune system insult in individuals with PTSD that is associated with the severity of symptoms.

          "abstract": "While macrophage heterogeneity during metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) has been described, the fate of these macrophages during MASH regression is poorly understood. Comparing macrophage heterogeneity during MASH progression vs regression, we identified specific macrophage subpopulations that are critical for MASH/fibrosis resolution. We elucidated the restorative pathways and gene signatures that define regression-associated macrophages and establish the importance of TREM2 + macrophages during MASH regression. Liver-resident Kupffer cells are lost during MASH and are replaced by four distinct monocyte-derived macrophage subpopulations. Trem2 is expressed in two macrophage subpopulations: i) monocyte-derived macrophages occupying the Kupffer cell niche (MoKC) and ii) lipid-associated macrophages (LAM). In regression livers, no new transcriptionally distinct macrophage subpopulation emerged. However, the relative macrophage composition changed during regression compared to MASH. While MoKC was the major macrophage subpopulation during MASH, they decreased during regression. LAM was the dominant macrophage subtype during MASH regression and maintained Trem2 expression. Both MoKC and LAM were enriched in disease-resolving pathways. Absence of TREM2 restricted the emergence of LAMs and formation of hepatic crown-like structures. TREM2 + macrophages are functionally important not only for restricting MASH-fibrosis progression but also for effective regression of inflammation and fibrosis. TREM2 + macrophages are superior collagen degraders. Lack of TREM2 + macrophages also prevented elimination of hepatic steatosis and inactivation of HSC during regression, indicating their significance in metabolic coordination with other cell types in the liver. TREM2 imparts this protective effect through multifactorial mechanisms, including improved phagocytosis, lipid handling, and collagen degradation.",

          "abstract": "Intercellular signaling mediated by evolutionarily conserved planar cell polarity (PCP) proteins aligns cell polarity along the tissue plane and drives polarized cell behaviors during tissue morphogenesis. Accumulating evidence indicates that the vertebrate PCP pathway is regulated by noncanonical, β-catenin-independent Wnt signaling; however, the signaling components and mechanisms are incompletely understood. In the mouse hearing organ, both PCP and noncanonical Wnt (ncWnt) signaling are required in the developing auditory sensory epithelium to control cochlear duct elongation and planar polarity of resident sensory hair cells (HCs), including the shape and orientation of the stereociliary hair bundle essential for sound detection. We have recently discovered a Wnt/G-protein/PI3K pathway that coordinates HC planar polarity and intercellular PCP signaling. Here, we identify Wnt7b as a ncWnt ligand acting in concert with Wnt5a to promote tissue elongation in diverse developmental processes. In the cochlea, Wnt5a and Wnt7b are redundantly required for cochlear duct coiling and elongation, HC planar polarity, and asymmetric localization of core PCP proteins Fzd6 and Dvl2. Mechanistically, Wnt5a/Wnt7b-mediated ncWnt signaling promotes membrane recruitment of Daple, a nonreceptor guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Gαi, and activates PI3K/AKT and ERK signaling, which promote asymmetric Fzd6 localization. Thus, ncWnt and PCP signaling pathways have distinct mutant phenotypes and signaling components, suggesting that they act as separate, parallel pathways with nonoverlapping functions in cochlear morphogenesis. NcWnt signaling drives tissue elongation and reinforces intercellular PCP signaling by regulating the trafficking of PCP-specific Frizzled receptors.",

Across nervous systems, the temporal patterning of spikes can code these events, but how this information is decoded (counted) remains elusive. In the anuran auditory system, temporal information of this type is decoded in the midbrain, where “interval-counting” neurons spike only after at least a threshold number of sound pulses have occurred with specific timing. We show that this decoding process, i.e., interval counting, arises from integrating phasic, onset-type and offset inhibition with excitation that augments across successive intervals, possibly due to a progressive decrease in “shunting” effects of inhibition. Because these physiological properties are ubiquitous within and across central nervous systems, interval counting may be a general mechanism for decoding diverse information coded/encoded in temporal patterns of spikes, including “bursts,” and estimating elapsed time.",

Our primary goal was to investigate how python hearts achieve this adaptive response after feeding. Isolated myofibrils increased force after feeding without changes in sarcomere ultrastructure and without increasing energy cost. Ca 2+ transients were prolonged after feeding with no changes in myofibril Ca 2+ sensitivity. Feeding reduced titin-based tension, resulting in decreased cardiac tissue stiffness. Feeding also reduced the activity of sirtuins, a metabolically linked class of histone deacetylases, and increased chromatin accessibility. Transcription factor enrichment analysis on transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing revealed the prominent role of transcription factors Yin Yang1 and NRF1 in postfeeding cardiac adaptation. Gene expression also changed with the enrichment of translation and metabolism. Finally, metabolomics analysis and adenosine triphosphate production demonstrated that cardiac adaptation after feeding not only increased energy demand but also energy production. These findings have broad implications for our understanding of cardiac adaptation across species and hold promise for the development of innovative approaches to address cardiovascular diseases.",

EPSPS is also the molecular target of the herbicide glyphosate. While some plant EPSPS variants have been characterized with reduced glyphosate sensitivity and have been used in biotechnology, the glyphosate insensitivity typically comes with a cost to catalytic efficiency. Thus, there exists a need to generate additional EPSPS variants that maintain both high catalytic efficiency and high glyphosate tolerance. Here, we create a synthetic yeast system to rapidly study and evolve heterologous EPSP synthases for these dual traits. Using known EPSPS variants, we first validate that our synthetic yeast system is capable of recapitulating growth characteristics observed in plants grown in varying levels of glyphosate. Next, we demonstrate that variants from mutagenesis libraries with distinct phenotypic traits can be isolated depending on the selection criteria applied. By applying strong dual-trait selection pressure, we identify a notable EPSPS mutant after just a single round of evolution that displays robust glyphosate tolerance (K i of nearly 1 mM) and improved enzymatic efficiency over the starting point (~2.5 fold). Finally, we show the crystal structure of corn EPSPS and the top resulting mutants and demonstrate that certain mutants have the potential to outperform previously reported glyphosate-resistant EPSPS mutants, such as T102I and P106S (denoted as TIPS), in whole-plant testing. Altogether, this platform helps explore the trade-off between glyphosate resistance and enzymatic efficiency.",

We provide a different perspective on this topic by integrating paleogenomic, archaeological, and isotopic data to gain insights into the role of one such elite group in a Langobard period community near Collegno, Italy dated to the 6-8th centuries CE. Our analysis of 28 newly sequenced genomes together with 24 previously published ones combined with isotope (Sr, C, N) measurements revealed that this community was established by and organized around a network of biologically and socially related individuals likely composed of multiple elite families that over time developed into a single extended pedigree. The community also included individuals with diverse genetic ancestries, maintaining its diversity by integrating newcomers and groups in later stages of its existence. This study highlights how shifts in political power and migration impacted the formation and development of a small rural community within a key region of the former Western Roman Empire after its dissolution and the emergence of a new kingdom. Furthermore, it suggests that Early Medieval elites had the capacity to incorporate individuals from varied backgrounds and that these elites were the result of (political) agency rather than belonging to biologically homogeneous groups.",

These assays fail to identify cells that have been exposed to the virus but limit or inhibit viral replication. To address this limitation, we used a dual-labeling vesicular stomatitis virus (DL-VSV), which has a deletion of the viral glycoprotein gene, to allow evaluation of primary infection outcomes. This virus encodes Cre, which can stably mark any cell with even a minimal level of viral gene expression. Additionally, the virus encodes GFP, which distinguishes cells with higher levels of viral gene expression, typically due to genome replication. Stereotactic injections of DL-VSV into the murine brain showed that different cell types had very different responses to the virus. Almost all neurons hosted high levels of viral gene expression, while glial cells varied in their responses. Astrocytes (Sox9+) were predominantly productively infected, while oligodendrocytes (Sox10+) were largely abortively infected. Microglial cells (Iba1+) were primarily uninfected. Furthermore, we monitored the early innate immune response to viral infection and identified unique patterns of interferon (IFN) induction. Shortly after infection, microglia were the main producers of IFNb , whereas later, oligodendrocytes were the main producers. IFNb + cells were primarily abortively infected regardless of cell type. Last, we investigated whether IFN signaling had any impact on the outcome of primary infection and did not observe significant changes, suggesting that intrinsic factors are likely responsible for determining the outcome of primary infection.",

Alternative polyadenylation (APA) greatly contributes to mRNA diversity in the cell. By determining the length of the 3’ untranslated region, APA generates transcripts with different regulatory elements, such as miRNA and RBP binding sites, which can influence mRNA stability, turnover, and translation. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana , APA is involved in the control of seed dormancy and flowering. In view of the physiological importance of APA in plants, we decided to investigate the effects of light/dark conditions and compare the underlying mechanisms to those elucidated for alternative splicing (AS). We found that light controls APA in approximately 30% of Arabidopsis genes. Similar to AS, the effect of light on APA requires functional chloroplasts, is not affected in mutants of the phytochrome and cryptochrome photoreceptor pathways, and is observed in roots only when the communication with the photosynthetic tissues is not interrupted. Furthermore, mitochondrial and TOR kinase activities are necessary for the effect of light. However, unlike AS, coupling with transcriptional elongation does not seem to be involved since light-dependent APA regulation is neither abolished in mutants of the TFIIS transcript elongation factor nor universally affected by chromatin relaxation caused by histone deacetylase inhibition. Instead, regulation seems to correlate with changes in the abundance of constitutive CPA factors, also mediated by the chloroplast.",

          "abstract": "Recent advances in single-cell sequencing technology have revolutionized our ability to acquire whole transcriptome data. However, uncovering the underlying transcriptional drivers and nonequilibrium driving forces of cell function directly from these data remains challenging. We address this by learning cell state vector fields from discrete single-cell RNA velocity to quantify the single-cell global nonequilibrium driving forces as landscape and flux. From single-cell data, we quantified the Waddington landscape, showing that optimal paths for differentiation and reprogramming deviate from the naively expected landscape gradient paths and may not pass through landscape saddles at finite fluctuations, challenging conventional transition state estimation of kinetic rate for cell fate decisions due to the presence of the flux. A key insight from our study is that stem/progenitor cells necessitate greater energy dissipation for rapid cell cycles and self-renewal, maintaining pluripotency. We predict optimal developmental pathways and elucidate the nucleation mechanism of cell fate decisions, with transition states as nucleation sites and pioneer genes as nucleation seeds. The concept of loop flux quantifies the contributions of each cycle flux to cell state transitions, facilitating the understanding of cell dynamics and thermodynamic cost, and providing insights into optimizing biological functions. We also infer cell–cell interactions and cell-type-specific gene regulatory networks, encompassing feedback mechanisms and interaction intensities, predicting genetic perturbation effects on cell fate decisions from single-cell omics data. Essentially, our methodology validates the landscape and flux theory, along with its associated quantifications, offering a framework for exploring the physical principles underlying cellular differentiation and reprogramming and broader biological processes through high-throughput single-cell sequencing experiments.",

We conducted whole-genome sequencing for these T cell clones and identified various somatic mutations in them with high clonality. Among the somatic mutations, an SH2D2A loss-of-function frameshift mutation and TNFAIP3 deletion could activate T cell effector functions in vitro. Furthermore, we generated CD8 + T cell–specific Tnfaip3 knockout mice and showed that Tnfaip3 function loss in CD8 + T cell increased antitumor immunity, leading to remarkable response to PD-1 blockade in vivo. In addition, we analyzed bulk CD3 + T cells from TILs in additional 12 patients and identified an SH2D2A mutation in one patient through amplicon sequencing.

To gain insights into 24 h dynamics of environmental signaling in nature, we performed a field study of signal transduction from the nucleus to chloroplasts in a natural population of Arabidopsis halleri. Using several modeling approaches to interpret the data, we identified that the circadian clock and temperature are key regulators of this pathway under natural conditions. We identified potential time-delay steps between pathway components, and diel fluctuations in the response of the pathway to temperature cues that are reminiscent of the process of circadian gating. We found that our modeling framework can be extended to other signaling pathways that undergo diel oscillations and respond to environmental cues. This approach of combining studies of gene expression in the field with modeling allowed us to identify the dynamic integration and transduction of environmental cues, in plant cells, under naturally fluctuating diel cycles.",

However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms governing PHP and CaV2 channels are not completely understood. Here, we uncover a previously not described form of PHP in Caenorhabditis elegans , revealing an inverse regulatory relationship between the efficiency of neurotransmitter release and the abundance of UNC-2/CaV2 channels. Gain-of-function unc-2SL(S240L) mutants, which carry a mutation analogous to the one causing familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 in humans, showed markedly reduced channel abundance despite increased channel functionality. Reducing synaptic release in these unc-2SL(S240L) mutants restored channel levels to those observed in wild-type animals. Conversely, loss-of-function unc-2DA(D726A) mutants, which harbor the D726A mutation in the channel pore, exhibited a marked increase in channel abundance. Enhancing synaptic release in unc-2DA mutants reversed this increase in channel levels. Importantly, this homeostatic regulation of UNC-2 channel levels is accompanied by the structural remodeling of the active zone (AZ); specifically, unc-2DA mutants, which exhibit increased channel abundance, showed parallel increases in select AZ proteins. Finally, our forward genetic screen revealed that WWP-1, a HECT family E3 ubiquitin ligase, is a key homeostatic mediator that removes UNC-2 from synapses. These findings highlight a self-tuning PHP regulating UNC-2/CaV2 channel abundance along with AZ reorganization, ensuring synaptic strength and stability.",

Here, we bridge the technical gap in scalable synthesis of larger submicron gene delivery vehicles by electrostatic self-assembly of charged nanoparticles, facilitated by a polymer structurally designed to modulate internanoparticle Coulombic and van der Waals forces. Specifically, our strategy permits controlled assembly of small poly(β-amino ester)/messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) nanoparticles into particles with a size that is kinetically tunable between 200 and 1,000 nm with high colloidal stability in physiological media. We found that assembled particles with an average size of 400 nm safely and most efficiently transfect monocytes following intravenous administration and mediate their differentiation into macrophages in the periphery. When a CpG adjuvant is co-loaded into the particles with an antigen mRNA, the monocytes differentiate into inflammatory dendritic cells and prime adaptive anticancer immunity in the tumor-draining lymph node.

LTP1 is mainly localized in the apoplast of uninfected plant cells, and after CPMV infection, most of the LTP1 is relocated to intracellular compartments, including chloroplast.

          "abstract": "RNA’s diversity of structures and functions impacts all life forms since primordia. We use calorimetric force spectroscopy to investigate RNA folding landscapes in previously unexplored low-temperature conditions. We find that Watson–Crick RNA hairpins, the most basic secondary structure elements, undergo a glass-like transition below T G ∼ 20 ° C where the heat capacity abruptly changes and the RNA folds into a diversity of misfolded structures. We hypothesize that an altered RNA biochemistry, determined by sequence-independent ribose–water interactions, outweighs sequence-dependent base pairing. The ubiquitous ribose–water interactions lead to universal RNA phase transitions below T G , such as maximum stability at T S ∼ 5 ° C where water density is maximum, and cold denaturation at T C ∼ − 50 ° C. RNA cold biochemistry may have a profound impact on RNA function and evolution.",

          "abstract": "Insect developmental transitions are precisely coordinated by ecdysone and juvenile hormone (JH). We previously revealed that accumulated H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) at the locus encoding JH signal transducer Hairy is involved in the larval–pupal transition in insects, but the underlying mechanism remains to be fully defined. Here, we show in Drosophila and Bombyx that Rpd3-mediated H3K27 deacetylation in the prothoracic gland during the last larval instar promotes ecdysone biosynthesis and the larval–pupal transition by enabling H3K27me3 accumulation at the Hairy locus to induce its transcriptional repression. Importantly, we find that the homeodomain transcription factor Schlank acts to switch active H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) to repressive H3K27me3 at the Hairy locus by directly binding to the Hairy promoter and then recruiting the histone deacetylase Rpd3 and the histone methyltransferase PRC2 component Su(z)12 through physical interactions. Moreover, Schlank inhibits Hairy transcription to facilitate the larval–pupal transition, and the Schlank signaling cascade is suppressed by JH but regulated in a positive feedback manner by ecdysone. Together, our data uncover that Schlank mediates epigenetic reprogramming of H3K27 modifications in hormone actions during insect developmental transition.",

          "abstract": "From microbes to humans, organisms perform numerous tasks for their survival, including food acquisition, migration, and reproduction. A complex biological task can be performed by either an autonomous organism or by cooperation among several specialized organisms. However, it remains unclear how autonomy and cooperation evolutionarily switch. Specifically, it remains unclear whether and how cooperative specialists can repair deleted genes through direct genetic exchange, thereby regaining metabolic autonomy. Here, we address this question by experimentally evolving a mutualistic microbial consortium composed of two specialists that cooperatively degrade naphthalene. We observed that autonomous genotypes capable of performing the entire naphthalene degradation pathway evolved from two cooperative specialists and dominated the community. This evolutionary transition was driven by the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between the two specialists. However, this evolution was exclusively observed in the fluctuating environment alternately supplied with naphthalene and pyruvate, where mutualism and competition between the two specialists alternated. The naphthalene-supplied environment exerted selective pressure that favors the expansion of autonomous genotypes. The pyruvate-supplied environment promoted the coexistence and cell density of the cooperative specialists, thereby increasing the likelihood of HGT. Using a mathematical model, we quantitatively demonstrate that environmental fluctuations facilitate the evolution of autonomy through HGT when the relative growth rate and carrying capacity of the cooperative specialists allow enhanced coexistence and higher cell density in the competitive environment. Together, our results demonstrate that cooperative specialists can repair deleted genes through a direct genetic exchange under specific conditions, thereby regaining metabolic autonomy.",

          "abstract": "Biomolecules can be sequestered into membrane-less compartments, referred to as biomolecular condensates. Experimental and computational methods have helped define the physical-chemical properties of condensates. Less is known about how the high macromolecule concentrations in condensed phases contribute “solvent” interactions that can remodel the free-energy landscape of other condensate-resident proteins, altering thermally accessible conformations and, in turn, modulating function. Here, we use solution NMR spectroscopy to obtain atomic resolution insights into the interactions between the immature form of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), which can mislocalize and aggregate in stress granules, and the RNA-binding protein CAPRIN1, a component of stress granules. NMR studies of CAPRIN1:SOD1 interactions, focused on both unfolded and folded SOD1 states in mixed phase and demixed CAPRIN1-based condensates, establish that CAPRIN1 shifts the SOD1 folding equilibrium toward the unfolded state through preferential interactions with the unfolded ensemble, with little change to the structure of the folded conformation. Key contacts between CAPRIN1 and the H80-H120 region of unfolded SOD1 are identified, as well as SOD1 interaction sites near both the arginine-rich and aromatic-rich regions of CAPRIN1. Unfolding of immature SOD1 in the CAPRIN1 condensed phase is shown to be coupled to aggregation, while a more stable zinc-bound, dimeric form of SOD1 is less susceptible to unfolding when solvated by CAPRIN1. Our work underscores the impact of the condensate solvent environment on the conformational states of resident proteins and supports the hypothesis that ALS mutations that decrease metal binding or dimerization function as drivers of aggregation in condensates.",

However, underlying mechanisms are substantially unknown. Comparing the gut microbiome and metabolome differences in mice fed a normal diet (ND) and high-fat diet (HFD), we uncover that the gut microbiota–dependent tryptophan metabolite 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA) is present at lower concentrations in mice with versus without insulin resistance. We further demonstrate that the microbial transformation of tryptophan into 5-HIAA is mediated by Burkholderia spp. Additionally, we show that the administration of 5-HIAA improves glucose intolerance and obesity in HFD-fed mice, while preserving hepatic insulin sensitivity. Mechanistically, 5-HIAA promotes hepatic insulin signaling by directly activating AhR, which stimulates TSC2 transcription and thus inhibits mTORC1 signaling. Moreover, T2D patients exhibit decreased fecal levels of 5-HIAA. Our findings identify a noncanonical pathway of microbially producing 5-HIAA from tryptophan and indicate that 5-HIAA might alleviate the pathogenesis of T2D.",

For stocks that were overfished, low value, or located in regions with rising temperatures, historical biomass estimates were generally overstated compared with updated assessments. Moreover, rising trends reported for overfished stocks were often inaccurate. With consideration of bias identified retrospectively, 85% more stocks than currently recognized have likely collapsed below 10% of maximum historical biomass.

Actin-spectrin scaffold disorganization increased clathrin-coated pit formation. Cargo uptake and live-cell imaging showed that AIS clathrin-coated pits are particularly stable. Neuronal plasticity-inducing stimulation triggered internalization of the clathrin-coated pits through polymerization of branched actin around them.

Using high-resolution imaging in more than 1800 human oocytes, we revealed a typical state of multipolar intermediates that form during spindle bipolarization and elucidated the mechanism underlying this process. We found that the minor poles formed in multiple kinetochore clusters contribute to the generation of multipolar intermediates. We further determined the essential roles of HAUS6, KIF11, and KIF18A in spindle bipolarization and identified mutations in these genes in infertile patients characterized by oocyte or embryo defects. These results provide insights into the physiological and pathological mechanisms of spindle bipolarization in human oocytes.",

          "abstract": "To reveal the connections between the 2024 moment magnitude ( M w ) 7.5 Noto earthquake in Japan and the seismicity swarms that preceded it, we investigated its rupture process through near-source waveform analysis and source imaging techniques, combining seismic and geodetic datasets. We found notable complexity in the initial rupture stages. A strong fault asperity, which remained unbroken in preceding seismic swarms, slowed down the rupture. Then, a second rupture initiated at the opposite edge of the asperity, and the asperity succumbed to double-pincer rupture fronts. The failure of this high-stress drop asperity drove the earthquake into a large-scale event. Our observations help unravel the crucial role of fault asperities in controlling swarm migration and rupture propagation and underscore the need for detailed seismological and interdisciplinary studies to assess seismic risk in swarm-prone regions.",

We demonstrate that the correlation of an axon branch’s activity with neighboring axons or postsynaptic neurons predicts whether the branch will be added, stabilized, or eliminated. Desynchronizing individual axons from their local networks, changing the pattern of correlated activity, or blocking N -methyl- d -aspartate receptors all significantly altered single-axon morphology.

Quantification analysis revealed that reducing the defined cation competition coefficient (η), which integrates the effects of ionic potential and sodium content, and increasing the particle size can enhance the resistance to acid attack, whereas using high-potential redox couples can eliminate oxidative degradation.

Turing imagined an “imitation game,” in which a human judge converses with both a computer and a human (a “foil”), each of which vies to convince the judge that they are the human. Importantly, the computer, foil, and judge do not see one another; they communicate entirely through text. After conversing with each candidate, the judge guesses which one is the real human.

Our indicator of the reproduction number R ( t ) was available days earlier than other estimates, with an innovative capability to decompose R ( t ) into contact rates and probabilities of infection. When Omicron arrived, the main epidemic driver switched from contacts to transmissibility. We separated contacts and transmissions by day of exposure and setting and found pronounced variability over days of the week and during Christmas holidays and events. For example, during the Euro football tournament in 2021, days with England matches showed sharp spikes in exposures and transmissibility. Digital contact-tracing technologies can help control epidemics not only by directly preventing transmissions but also by enabling rapid analysis at scale and with unprecedented resolution.",

The biological mechanisms underpinning these dynamics remain elusive, particularly concerning how shifts in the composition of memory-encoding neuronal ensembles influence the evolution of a memory over time. By targeting developmentally distinct subpopulations of principal neurons, we discovered that memory encoding resulted in the concurrent establishment of multiple memory traces in the mouse hippocampus. Two of these traces were instantiated in subpopulations of early- and late-born neurons and followed distinct reactivation trajectories after encoding. The divergent recruitment of these subpopulations underpinned gradual reorganization of memory ensembles and modulated memory persistence and plasticity across multiple learning episodes.

If these seDSBs are not promptly repaired, arrival of adjacent forks creates double-ended DSBs (deDSBs), which could drive genomic scarring in HR-deficient cancers. deDSBs can also be generated directly when the replication fork bypasses lagging-strand nicks. Unlike deDSBs produced independently of replication, end resection at nick-induced seDSBs and deDSBs is BRCA1-independent. Nevertheless, BRCA1 antagonizes 53BP1 suppression of RAD51 filament formation. These results highlight distinctive mechanisms that maintain replication fork stability.",

We identified hundreds of deleterious mutations that inactivate individual homodimers but produce functional enzymes when coexpressed as duplicated proteins that heterodimerize. The structure of one such heteromer reveals how both losses of function are buffered through the introduction of asymmetry in the complex that allows them to subfunctionalize.

          "abstract": "Storytelling is a powerful tool that connects us and shapes our understanding of the world. Theories of effective storytelling boast an intellectual history dating back millennia, highlighting the significance of narratives across civilizations. Yet, despite all this theorizing, empirically predicting what makes a story successful has remained elusive. We propose narrative reversals, key turning points in a story, as pivotal facets that predict story success. Drawing on narrative theory, we conceptualize reversals as plot: essential moments that push narratives forward and shape audience reception. Across 30,000 movies, TV shows, novels, and fundraising pitches, we use computational linguistics and trend detection analysis to develop a quantitative method for measuring narrative reversals via shifts in valence. We find that stories with more‚ and more dramatic, turning points are more successful. Our findings shed light on this age-old art form and provide a practical approach to understanding and predicting the impact of storytelling.",

          "abstract": "Rapid demographic growth in tropical islands can exacerbate conflicts and pressures on natural resources, as illustrated by the French island of Mayotte where resources are limited. In only 10 years, uncontrolled migration and population growth (+80% of population between 2002 and 2021) have led to a pronounced 3600% increase in deforestation rates (2010–2014) and an intensification of agricultural practices, escalating conflicts over limited land, water, and biodiversity resources. Implementing an original multi-proxy approach to sediment cores, our study reveals a staggering 300% acceleration in erosion during the first wave of migration (2011–2015), followed by a further 190% increase (2019–2021) under sustained migratory and demographic pressures. Sedimentary DNA analysis provided insights into increased connectivity and community changes. By 2050, the population of this region will increase by 74 and 103%, in Comoros and Madagascar islands, respectively. Urgent conservation measures are needed to avoid major socio-environmental crises and to protect resources for future generations.",

          "abstract": "The number of health care educational institutions/organizations adopting implicit bias training is growing. Our systematic review of 77 studies (published 1 January 2003 through 21 September 2022) investigated how implicit bias training in health care is designed/delivered and whether gaps in knowledge translation compromised the reliability and validity of the training. The primary training target was race/ethnicity (49.3%); trainings commonly lack specificity on addressing implicit prejudice or stereotyping (67.5%). They involved a combination of hands-on and didactic approaches, lasting an average of 343.15 min, often delivered in a single day (53.2%). Trainings also exhibit translational gaps, diverging from current literature (10 to 67.5%), and lack internal (99.9%), face (93.5%), and external (100%) validity. Implicit bias trainings in health care are characterized by bias in methodological quality and translational gaps, potentially compromising their impacts.",

Leveraging the Marine Atlas of Tara Oceans Unigenes, we investigate the genomic potential of primary production in the global ocean. The latter is performed by ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RUBISCO) and is often associated with carbon concentration mechanisms in piconanoplankton, major marine unicellular photosynthetic organisms. We show that the genomic potential supporting C 4 enzymes and RUBISCO exhibits strong functional redundancy and important affinity toward tropical oligotrophic waters. This redundancy is taxonomically structured by the dominance of Mamiellophyceae and Prymnesiophyceae in mid and high latitudes. These findings enhance our understanding of the relationship between functional and taxonomic diversity of microorganisms and environmental drivers of key biogeochemical cycles.",

As teeth dominate the fossil record and preserve genetic signatures in their morphology, we compiled a large dataset of 450 dentitions dating between ~47 and 7 thousand years ago (ka), outnumbering existing skeletal and paleogenetic datasets. We tested a range of competing demographic scenarios using a coalescent-based machine learning Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) framework that we modified for use with phenotypic data. Mostly in agreement with but also challenging some of the hitherto available evidence, we identified a population turnover in western Europe at ~28 ka, isolates in western and eastern refugia between ~28 and 14.7 ka, and bottlenecks during the Last Glacial Maximum.

Here, we demonstrate three-dimensional reconfigurable DNA origami pincers (DOPs) that multitask on giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). By programmably adjusting their pinching angle, the DOPs can dynamically control the degree of GUV remodeling. When oligomerized on the GUV to form origami cages, the DOP units interact with one another and undergo reorganization, resulting in the capture, compartmentalization, and detachment of lipid fragments. This oligomerization process is accompanied with membrane disruptions, enabling the passage of cargo across the membrane.

Arranging these elements across three-dimensional space enables accurate, hysteresis-free, and decoupled measurements of temperature, normal force, and shear force. Assembly of such sensors on flexible printed circuit boards together with commercial electronics forms various flexible electronic systems with capabilities in wireless measurements at the skin interface, continuous monitoring of biomechanical signals, and spatial mapping of tactile information.

Here, we report a powerful method to overcome this limitation using dynamic long-range organization of chiral perovskites guided by the incorporation of chiral dopants, which induces strong interactions between chiral dopants and chiral cations. The additional interplay of chiral cations with chiral dopants reorganizes the morphological and crystallographic properties of chiral perovskites, notably enhancing the asymmetric behavior of chiral 2D perovskites by more than 10-fold, along with the highest dissymmetry factor of photocurrent ( g Ph ) of ~1.16 reported to date.

To explore cell-mediated control of tissue stiffness, we developed mutations in the mechanosensitive protein talin 1 to alter cellular sensing of ECM. Mutation of a mechanosensitive site between talin 1 rod-domain helix bundles R1 and R2 increased cell spreading and tension exertion on compliant substrates. These mutations promote binding of the ARP2/3 complex subunit ARPC5L, which mediates the change in substrate stiffness sensing. Ascending aortas from mice bearing these mutations showed less fibrillar collagen, reduced axial stiffness, and lower rupture pressure. Together, these results demonstrate that cellular stiffness sensing contributes to ECM mechanics, directly supporting the mechanical homeostasis hypothesis and identifying a mechanosensitive interaction within talin that contributes to this mechanism.",

The cutting-edge temporal resolution of these imaging tools is on the order of a few tens to a hundred femtoseconds, limiting imaging to the atomic dynamics and leaving electron motion imaging out of reach. Here, we obtained the attosecond temporal resolution in the transmission electron microscope, which we coined “attomicroscopy.” We demonstrated this resolution by the attosecond diffraction measurements of the field-driven electron dynamics in graphene. This attosecond imaging tool would provide more insights into electron motion and directly connect it to the structural dynamics of matter in real-time and space domains, opening the door for long-anticipated real-life attosecond science applications in quantum physics, chemistry, and biology.",

Unlike conventional assays, which rely on indirect measurements of metastatic potential, our method uses three-dimensional microchannels to measure the basal native invasiveness without chemoattractants or microfluidics. No change in cell death or proliferation is observed on our chips. Using six cancer cell lines, we show that our system is more sensitive than other motility-based assays, measures of nuclear deformability, or cell morphometrics.

SR whistlers provide a low-latitude channel to transport lightning energy to the magnetosphere. We calculate the relative contributions of SR, magnetospherically reflected, subprotonospheric, and ducted whistlers to the lightning energy reaching the magnetosphere. When SR whistlers are considered, the global lightning energy contribution to the magnetosphere doubles, implying that the previous estimates of the impact of lightning energy on radiation belts may need substantial revisions. Whistler dispersion and intensity analyses quantitatively confirm our results and suggest new remote-sensing methods of the magnetosphere, ionosphere, Earth-ionosphere waveguide, and lightning flashes.",

Photoluminescence measurements in the presence of radio frequency radiation reveal that the hyperfine interaction between the nuclear and electron spins is enhanced by two orders of magnitude.

This approach allows the incorporation of diverse side-chain combinations. Second, nitrogen atom fusing neighboring aromatics is realized by using oxo-molybdenum catalyst, featuring lower reaction temperatures and enhanced yields. Third, an organic catalyst, proline, is identified to catalyze the aldol condensation with high yield to afford the most typical FREAs having acceptor-donor-acceptor (ADA) configurations.

Here, we implement a physically motivated parameterization in three ice sheet models and simulate the response of the Amundsen Sea Embayment after a hypothetical collapse of floating ice. All models show that Thwaites Glacier would not retreat further in the 21st century. In another set of simulations, we force the grounding line to retreat into Thwaites’ deeper basin to expose a taller cliff. In these simulations, rapid thinning and velocity increase reduce the calving rate, stabilizing the cliff.

Hence, Darwinian evolution would not be possible, and the population would be vulnerable to collapse due to the rapid spread of parasitic RNAs. In this study, we show that distilled water, mimicking rain/freshwater, leads to the formation of electrostatic crosslinks on the interface of coacervate droplets that not only suppress droplet fusion indefinitely but also allow the spatiotemporal compartmentalization of RNA on a timescale of days depending on the length and structure of RNA.

We ordered the patients with cerebral malaria based on their EV-transcriptional profiles from cross-sectionally collected samples and inferred disease trajectory while using healthy community controls as a starting point. We found that neuronal transcripts in plasma EVs decreased with disease trajectory, whereas transcripts from glial, endothelial, and immune cells increased. Disease trajectory correlated positively with severity indicators like death and was associated with increased VEGFA-VEGFR and glutamatergic signaling, as well as platelet and neutrophil activation.

The SERS surgical navigation is principally based on the multifunctional optical probes (namely, MATRA probes) integrating with T 1 -weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, photothermal effect and Raman spectroscopic detection. We demonstrate in a 4T1 breast tumor mouse model that the pre-surgical MR/SERS dual-modal imaging is capable of providing comprehensive tumor information, and intraoperative SERS detection allows accurately delineating the tumor margins and guiding the surgical resection in real time with the least residual microscopic foci. We verify that the postsurgical immunotherapy effectively eradicates those local microtumor lesions and invisible distant metastases, greatly inhibiting the postsurgical cancer recurrence and distant metastasis.",

Here, we combine x-ray radiography with a novel high-pressure/high-temperature apparatus to observe and quantify in real-time bubble growth and coalescence in basaltic magmas from 100 megapascals to surface. For low-viscosity magmas, bubbles coalesce and recover a spherical shape within 3 seconds, implying that, for lava fountaining activity, gas and melt remain coupled during the ascent up to the last hundred meters of the conduit. For higher-viscosity magmas, recovery times become longer, promoting connected bubble pathways.

Sediment gravity flows typically erode material along their path (bulking), which can dramatically increase their size, speed, and run-out distance. Hence, flow bulking is a first-order control on flow evolution and underpins predictive modeling approaches and geohazard assessments. Quantifying bulking in submarine systems is problematic because of their large-scale and inaccessible nature, complex stratigraphy, and poorly understood source areas. Here, we map the deposits and erosive destruction of a giant submarine gravity flow from source to sink. The small initial failure (~1.5 cubic kilometers) entrained over 100 times its starting volume, catastrophically evolving into a giant flow with a total volume of ~162 cubic kilometers and a run-out distance of ~2000 kilometers. Entrainment of mud was the critical fuel, which promoted run-away flow growth and extreme levels of erosion.",

In this study, we demonstrate that IL-4 enhances anti-inflammatory microglia reactivity, ameliorates the pathological features of PD, and reciprocally affects expression of β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 in microglia in PD mouse models. We also show that manipulation of two β-arrestins produces contrary effects on the anti-inflammatory states and neuroprotective action of microglia induced by IL-4 in vivo and in vitro. We further find that the functional antagonism of two β-arrestins is mediated through sequential activation of sterile alpha motif domain containing 4 (Samd4), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Collectively, these data reveal opposing functions of two closely related β-arrestins in regulating the IL-4–induced microglia reactivity via the Samd4/mTOR/OXPHOS axis in PD mouse models and provide important insights into the pathogenesis and therapeutics of PD.",

To tackle these challenges, we fabricate AuPtCoPS trimetallic-based nanocarriers (TBNCs), with enzyme-like activity and plasmid loading capabilities, aiming to efficiently eradicate ROS, facilitate delivery of therapeutic genes, and ultimately improve the therapeutic efficacy. TBNCs also function as a computed tomography contrast agent for tracking mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) during therapy. Accordingly, we enhanced the antioxidant stress and anti-inflammatory capabilities of engineered MSCs and successfully visualized their biological behavior in IPF mice in vivo.

Combining pulsed DNP with nanoscale force-detected magnetic resonance measurements, we demonstrated a 100-fold enhancement in the Boltzmann polarization of proton spins in nanoscale sugar droplets at 6 kelvin and 0.33 tesla. Crucially, this enhancement corresponds to a factor of 200 reduction in the averaging time compared to measurements that rely on the detection of statistical fluctuations in nanoscale nuclear spin ensembles.

Increases are driven primarily by intensification of human population densities, not change in wildlife distributions caused by climate change.

The indirect effect dominates the hydrological responses to deforestation over 63% of deforested areas worldwide. This indirect effect arises from deforestation-induced reductions in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, which decrease and increase runoff, respectively, leading to complex patterns of runoff responses. Our findings underscore the importance of forest-climate feedbacks for improved understanding and prediction of climate and hydrological changes caused by deforestation, with profound implications for sustainable management of forests and water resources.",

However, it is still challenging for a single HTL to fulfill all these stringent criteria. Here, we demonstrate a general design of doping-bilayer polymer-HTL architecture for stabilizing high-efficiency QLEDs. We show that the bilayer HTLs combining the electrochemical-stable polymer and the electron-blocking polymer unexpectedly increase the hole injection barrier. We mitigated the problem by p-doping of the underlying sublayer of the bilayer HTLs. Consequently, green QLEDs with an unprecedented maximum luminance of 1,340,000 cd m −2 and a record-long operational lifetime ( T 95 lifetime at an initial luminance of 1000 cd m −2 is 17,700 hours) were achieved.

Herein, we found a strong positive correlation between circulating EPI levels and the tumoral expression of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 22 (USP22) in patients with breast cancer. USP22 facilitated EPI-induced breast cancer progression and metastasis by enhancing adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL)–mediated lipolysis. Targeted USP22 deletion decreased ATGL expression and lipolysis, subsequently inhibiting EPI-mediated breast cancer lung metastasis. USP22 acts as a bona fide deubiquitinase for the Atgl gene transcription factor FOXO1, and EPI architects a lipolysis signaling pathway to stabilize USP22 through AKT-mediated phosphorylation. Notably, USP22 phosphorylation levels are positively associated with EPI and with downstream pathways involving both FOXO1 and ATGL in breast cancers. Pharmacological USP22 inhibition synergized with β-blockers in treating preclinical xenograft breast cancer models. This study reveals a molecular pathway behind EPI’s tumor-promoting effects and provides a strong rationale for combining USP22 inhibition with β-blockers to treat aggressive breast cancer.",

In addition, chronic itch is accompanied with enhanced activity and synaptic plasticity of excitatory projections from the thalamic nucleus reuniens (Re) onto LS GABAergic neurons. Selective chemogenetic inhibition of the Re → LS circuit notably alleviated chronic itch–induced anxiety, with no impact on anxiety induced by restraint stress.

We show here that the zona pellucida domain–containing protein Dusky-like is essential for normal corneal lens morphogenesis. Dusky-like transiently localizes to the expanded apical surfaces of the corneal lens-secreting cells and prevents them from undergoing apical constriction and apicobasal contraction. Dusky-like also controls the arrangement of two other zona pellucida domain proteins, Dumpy and Piopio, external to the developing corneal lens. Loss of either dusky-like or dumpy delays chitin accumulation and disrupts the outer surface of the corneal lens. We find that artificially inducing apical constriction by activating myosin contraction is sufficient to similarly alter chitin deposition and corneal lens morphology.

Sediment cores are used to quantify organic matter (OM) density, estimated by multiplying the bulk density of a core segment by its OM fraction. This method can be imprecise, as repeated samples often differ widely. Recent studies have shown that sediment bulk density and OM fraction are not independent but tightly related by a function called the ideal-mixing model. Thus, the bulk density of the sediment can be directly estimated from its OM fraction. Statistical theory and simulations demonstrate that the high variance in the product estimation of OM density is the result of error propagation in the product of two functionally related variables with independent errors. Estimating OM density in wetland sediments using the ideal-mixing model is more precise than the traditionally used product estimate, especially in highly organic sediments.",

We found that this activity enhancement depends on the molecular chaperone PARK7/DJ-1, whose loss of function significantly disrupts axonal bioenergetics.

The nucleus deforms reversibly with a reduction in volume during confinement. With decreasing channel width, the nuclear shape during transmigration changes biphasically, concomitant with the transitioning dynamics.

Here, we find that by 2050, high-ambition compared to low-ambition N interventions reduce global ammonia and nitrogen oxide emissions by 21 and 22 TgN/a, respectively, equivalent to 40 and 52% of their 2015 levels. This would mitigate population-weighted PM2.5 by 6 g/m 3 and avoid premature deaths by 817 k (16%), mitigate ozone by 4 ppbv, avoid premature deaths by 252k (34%) and crop yield losses by 122 million tons (4.3%), and decrease terrestrial ecosystem areas exceeding critical load by 420 Mha (69%). Without nitrogen interventions, most environmental damages examined will deteriorate between 2015 and 2050; Africa and Asia are the most vulnerable but also benefit the most from interventions. Nitrogen interventions support sustainable development goals related to air, health, and ecosystems.",

Notably, germline stem cells in both vertebrates and invertebrates express highly conserved RNA binding proteins, such as nanos , vasa , and piwi . In highly regenerative animals, these genes are also expressed in somatic stem cells, which led to the proposal that they had an ancestral role in all stem cells. In cnidarians, multi- and pluripotent interstitial stem cells have only been identified in hydrozoans. Therefore, it is currently unclear if cnidarian stem cell systems share a common evolutionary origin. We, therefore, aimed to characterize conserved stem cell marker genes in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis . Through transgenic reporter genes and single-cell transcriptomics, we identify cell populations expressing the germline-associated markers piwi1 and nanos2 in the soma and germline, and gene knockout shows that Nanos2 is indispensable for germline formation. This suggests that nanos and piwi genes have a conserved role in somatic and germline stem cells in cnidarians.",

We propose a machine learning–based approach that uses convolutional neural networks to create dynamically consistent counterfactual versions of historical extreme events under different levels of global mean temperature (GMT). We apply this technique to one recent extreme heat event (southcentral North America 2023) and several historical events that have been previously analyzed using established attribution methods. We estimate that temperatures during the southcentral North America event were 1.18° to 1.42°C warmer because of global warming and that similar events will occur 0.14 to 0.60 times per year at 2.0°C above preindustrial levels of GMT. Additionally, we find that the learned relationships between daily temperature and GMT are influenced by the seasonality of the forced temperature response and the daily meteorological conditions. Our results broadly agree with other attribution techniques, suggesting that machine learning can be used to perform rapid, low-cost attribution of extreme events.",

In certain scenarios, such controllers may lead to “integral windup,” an adverse condition caused by saturating control elements, which manifests as error accumulation, poor dynamic performance, or instabilities. To mitigate this effect, we here introduce several biomolecular anti-windup topologies and link them to control-theoretic anti-windup strategies. This is achieved using a novel model reduction theory that we develop for reaction networks with fast sequestration reactions. We then show how the anti-windup topologies can be realized as reaction networks and propose intein-based genetic designs for their implementation. We validate our designs through simulations on various biological systems, including models of patients with type I diabetes and advanced biomolecular proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers, demonstrating their efficacy in mitigating windup effects and ensuring safety.",

Leveraging the micromolar detection sensitivity for 6-azido-trehalose (TreAz) and the 300-nm spatial resolution of MIP imaging, the trehalose recycling pathway in single mycobacteria, from cytoplasmic uptake to membrane localization, is directly visualized. A peak shift of azide in MIP spectrum further uncovers interactions between TreAz and intracellular protein. MIP mapping of unreacted azide after click reaction reveals click chemistry heterogeneity within a bacterium.

The fertile porphyries and coeval mafic magmas display mainly positive Δ 199 Hg values (up to +0.25 per mil), while Δ 199 Hg values in barren magmatic rocks and mafic magmas are largely negative (−0.54 to 0.00 per mil). The positive Δ 199 Hg values observed here are consistent with seawater and marine sediments, suggesting that the ultimate source of fluids involved in the genesis of post-subduction porphyry copper deposits was the mantle lithosphere metasomatized by previous oceanic plate subduction.

Hence, inspired by magnets attracting metals, we combine polyether F127 diacrylate (FDA) with tannin (TA) to construct a magnetically attracting hydrogel (FDA-TA). This hydrogel demonstrates the capability to adsorb ex-iron and remodel the iron metabolism of cells. Furthermore, it exhibits good toughness and self-healing properties. Notably, it can activate the PI3K-AKT pathway to inhibit nuclear receptor coactivator 4–mediated ferritinophagy under ex-iron enrichment conditions. The curative effect and related mechanism are further confirmed in vivo. Consequently, on the basis of the pathological mechanism, a targeted hydrogel is designed to reshape iron metabolism, offering insights for tissue repair.",

Here, we reassess its validity from different timescales and broader observations from the pantropics. Unexpectedly, our findings contradict the theory on daily, monthly, and even annual timescales. Pantropical precipitation isotope ratios remain strongly correlated to convection intensity but are independent of rain type proportions because stratiform precipitation isotope ratios cover a large range of values.

While the influence of such curvature on the strength of the tool has been explored, its biomechanical role in puncture performance remains untested. Here, we investigate the effect of curvature on puncture mechanics by integrating experiments with finite element simulations. Our findings reveal that within a wide biologically relevant range, structural curvature has a minimal impact on key metrics of damage initiation or the energies required for deep penetration in isotropic and homogeneous target materials. This unexpected result improves our understanding of the biomechanical pressures driving the morphological diversity of curved puncture tools and provides fundamental insights into the crucial roles of curvature in the biomechanical functions of living puncture systems.",

The charge around oxygen is distorted by the increasing Co─O covalency. The charge distortion causes the difference of vdW gap between O3 and O1 phases, verified by a gap corrected vdW equation. In a high charging state, excessive covalency breaks the vdW gap balance, driving the O3 phase toward a stable O1 one. This interpretation of vdWi-dominated phase transition can be applied to other layered materials, as shown by a map regarding degree of covalence.

Merging this record with other Fiji and central tropical Pacific records, we reconstruct the SST gradient between the southwestern and central Pacific (SWCP), providing a reliable proxy for IPO variability from 1370 to 1997. This reconstruction reveals distinct centennial-scale temperature trends and insights into Pacific-wide climate impacts and teleconnections. Notably, the 20th century conditions, marked by simultaneous basin-scale warming and weak tropical Pacific zonal-meridional gradients, deviate from trends observed during the past six centuries. Combined with model simulations, our findings reveal that a weak SWCP gradient most markedly affects IPO-related rainfall patterns in the equatorial Pacific.

Here, we study the competing reduction of CO 2 and N 2 by the two nitrogenases of Rhodobacter capsulatus , the molybdenum and the iron nitrogenase. The iron nitrogenase is almost threefold more efficient in CO 2 reduction and profoundly less selective for N 2 than the molybdenum isoform under mixtures of N 2 and CO 2 . Correspondingly, the growth rate of diazotrophically grown R. capsulatus strains relying on the iron nitrogenase notably decreased after adding CO 2 .

By using virome-enriched long-read metagenomic sequencing across 91 individuals, we identified a total of 14,438 nonredundant phage SVs and revealed their prevalence within the human gut phageome. These SVs are mainly enriched in genes involved in recombination, DNA methylation, and antibiotic resistance. Notably, a substantial fraction of phage SV sequences share close homology with bacterial fragments, with most SVs enriched for horizontal gene transfer (HGT) mechanism. Further investigations showed that these SV sequences were genetic exchanged between specific phage-bacteria pairs, particularly between phages and their respective bacterial hosts. Temperate phages exhibit a higher frequency of genetic exchange with bacterial chromosomes and then virulent phages. Collectively, our findings provide insights into the genetic landscape of the human gut phageome.",

          "abstract": "Perceptual learning leads to improvement in behavioral performance, yet how the brain supports challenging perceptual demands is unknown. We used two photon imaging in the mouse primary auditory cortex during behavior in a Go-NoGo task designed to test perceptual difficulty. Using general linear model analysis, we found a subset of neurons that increased their responses during high perceptual demands. Single neurons increased their responses to both Go and NoGo sounds when mice were engaged in the more difficult perceptual discrimination. This increased responsiveness contributes to enhanced cortical network discriminability for the learned sounds. Under passive listening conditions, the same neurons responded weaker to the more similar sound pairs of the difficult task, and the training protocol by itself induced specific suppression to the learned sounds. Our findings identify how neuronal activity in auditory cortex is modulated during high perceptual demands, which is a fundamental feature associated with perceptual improvement.",

In plants, one such innovation is the evolution of zygomorphic flowers, which is thought to promote outcrossing and increase flower morphological diversity. We isolated three allelic mutants from two Mimulus species displaying altered floral symmetry and identified the causal gene as the ortholog of Arabidopsis BLADE-ON-PETIOLE . We found that MlBOP and MlCYC2A physically interact and this BOP-CYC interaction module is highly conserved across the angiosperms. Furthermore, MlBOP self-ubiquitinates and suppresses MlCYC2A self-activation. MlCYC2A, in turn, impedes MlBOP ubiquitination. Thus, this molecular tug-of-war between MlBOP and MlCYC2A fine-tunes the expression of MlCYC2A , contributing to the formation of bilateral symmetry in flowers, a key trait in angiosperm evolution.",

An ultrathin TBD-SBF membrane (~20 nm) exhibits up to 220 times improved solvent permeance with a moderate molecular weight cutoff (~640 g mol −1 ) compared to the control membrane prepared by conventional chemistry, which outperforms currently reported polymeric membranes.

Here, we develop a sprayable biomimetic double wound mask (BDM) with rapid autophasing and hierarchical programming for scarless wound healing. The BDMs comprise hydrophobic poly (lactide- co –propylene glycol– co -lactide) dimethacrylate (PLD) as top layer and hydrophilic gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel as bottom layer, enabling swift autophasing into bilayered structure. After photocrosslinking, BDMs rapidly solidify with strong interfacial bonding, robust tissue adhesion, and excellent joint adaptiveness. Upon implementation, the bottom GelMA layer could immediately release calcium ion for rapid hemostasis, while the top PLD layer could maintain a moist, breathable, and sterile environment. These traits synergistically suppress the inflammatory tumor necrosis factor–α pathway while coordinating the cyclic guanosine monophosphate/protein kinase G–Wnt/calcium ion signaling pathways to nourish angiogenesis. Collectively, our BDMs with self-regulated construction of bilayered structure could hierarchically program the healing progression with transformative potential for scarless wound healing.",

Here, we identify 18 proteins that make up the spiders’ strongest silk type, the major ampullate fiber. Single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics revealed that the secretory epithelium of the gland harbors six cell types. These cell types are confined to three distinct glandular zones that produce specific combinations of silk proteins. Image analysis of histological sections showed that the secretions from the three zones do not mix, and proteomics analysis revealed that these secretions form layers in the final fiber. Using a multi-omics approach, we provide substantial advancements in the understanding of the structure and function of the major ampullate silk gland as well as of the architecture and composition of the fiber it produces.",

          "abstract": "Postoperative rehemorrhage following intracerebral hemorrhage surgery is intricately associated with a high mortality rate, yet there is now no effective clinical treatment. In this study, we developed a hemoglobin (Hb)–responsive in situ implantable DNA hydrogel comprising Hb aptamers cross-linked with two complementary chains and encapsulating deferoxamine mesylate (DFO). Functionally, the hydrogel generates signals upon postoperative rehemorrhage by capturing Hb, demonstrating a distinctive “self-diagnosis” capability. In addition, the ongoing capture of Hb mediates the gradual disintegration of the hydrogel, enabling the on-demand release of DFO without compromising physiological iron-dependent functions. This process achieves self-treatment by inhibiting the ferroptosis of neurocytes. In a collagenase and autologous blood injection model–induced mimic postoperative rehemorrhage model, the hydrogel exhibited a 5.58-fold increase in iron absorption efficiency, reducing hematoma size significantly (from 8.674 to 4.768 cubic millimeters). This innovative Hb-responsive DNA hydrogel not only offers a therapeutic intervention for postoperative rehemorrhage but also provides self-diagnosis feedback, holding notable promise for enhancing clinical outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection, the rearrangement of magnetic field topologies, is a fundamental plasma process throughout the universe, which converts magnetic energy to plasma kinetic energy and results in particle energization. A current sheet is a prerequisite for the occurrence of magnetic reconnection. It has been well documented that reconnecting current sheets are prevalent in turbulent plasmas. However, how these current sheets are formed remains unclear. Among natural plasmas, the region downstream of the Earth’s bow shock, the magnetosheath, is one of the most turbulent. Here, we show that the reconnecting current sheets in the turbulent magnetosheath originate from the waves in the region upstream of the shock. Once excited, the upstream waves are transmitted across the shock, compressed, and then transformed into current sheets in the downstream region. Magnetic reconnection subsequently occurs in these downstream current sheets. This process can be generalized to various shocked plasmas in astrophysical and laboratorial environments where turbulent magnetic reconnection should be common.",

          "abstract": "Volatile element abundances vary substantially among terrestrial planetary bodies like Earth, Mars, Moon, and differentiated asteroids, leading to intense debate about the governing processes. howardites-eucrites-diogenites (HED) meteorites, most likely from asteroid 4-Vesta, represent highly volatile-depleted Solar System samples, offering critical insights into these processes. Zinc is a moderately volatile element and its isotopic composition reveals sources of volatiles in planetary bodies. Our study finds Zn isotopic anomalies in diogenites overlapping with noncarbonaceous reservoirs, indicating negligible contributions of outer solar system materials to 4-Vesta’s volatiles. Besides, zinc isotopic composition of 4-Vesta is lighter than that of chondrites, contrary to the expected signature of evaporation-based volatile depletion. This suggests that after 4-Vesta lost all its volatiles through evaporation during the magma ocean stage, partial kinetic recondensation occurred that produced the observed isotopically light composition. These insights, combined with previous data, underscore the process of global evaporation followed by partial condensation as a key factor influencing the final volatile budget of planetary bodies.",

If extended to the petahertz scale in a compact and scalable form, harmonic mixers would enable field-resolved optical signal analysis spanning octaves of spectra in a monolithic device without the need for frequency conversion using nonlinear crystals. Here, we demonstrate lightwave-electronic harmonic frequency mixing beyond 0.350 PHz using plasmonic nanoantennas. We demonstrate that the mixing process enables complete, field-resolved detection of spectral content far outside that of the local oscillator, greatly extending the range of detectable frequencies compared to conventional heterodyning techniques. Our work has important implications for applications where optical signals of interest exhibit coherent femtosecond-scale dynamics spanning multiple harmonics.",

These myokines exert both local and pleiotropic health benefits, underscoring the crucial role of muscle function in countering obesity and contributing to the overall positive effects of exercise on health. Here, we found that exercise activates muscle p38γ, increasing locomotor activity through the secretion of interleukin-15 (IL-15). IL-15 signals in the motor cortex, stimulating locomotor activity. This activation of muscle p38γ, leading to an increase locomotor activity, plays a crucial role in reducing the risk of diabetes and liver steatosis, unveiling a vital muscle-brain communication pathway with profound clinical implications. The correlation between p38γ activation in human muscle during acute exercise and increased blood IL-15 levels highlights the potential therapeutic relevance of this pathway in treating obesity and metabolic diseases.

Osmotic activation of the choline transporter BetT promotes the uptake of external choline for synthesizing the osmoprotective glycine betaine. Here, we report the cryo–electron microscopy structures of Pseudomonas syringae BetT in the apo and choline-bound states. Our structure shows that BetT forms a domain-swapped trimer with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of one protomer interacting with the transmembrane domain (TMD) of a neighboring protomer. The substrate choline is bound within a tryptophan prism at the central part of TMD. Together with functional characterization, our results suggest that in Pseudomonas species, including the plant pathogen P. syringae and the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa , BetT is locked at a low-activity state through CTD-mediated autoinhibition in the absence of osmotic stress, and its hyperosmotic activation involves the release of this autoinhibition.",

We find that phylogenies in particular can detect novel transmission-enhancing variants very soon after their origin and may facilitate the development of early detection systems for outbreak surveillance.",
