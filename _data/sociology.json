          "title": "A Primer on Deep Learning for Causal Inference",
          "authors": "Bernard J. Koch, Tim Sainburg, Pablo Geraldo Bastías, Song Jiang, Yizhou Sun, Jacob G. Foster",
          "abstract": "This primer systematizes the emerging literature on causal inference using deep neural networks under the potential outcomes framework. It provides an intuitive introduction to building and optimizing custom deep learning models and shows how to adapt them to estimate/predict heterogeneous treatment effects. It also discusses ongoing work to extend causal inference to settings where confounding is nonlinear, time-varying, or encoded in text, networks, and images. To maximize accessibility, we also introduce prerequisite concepts from causal inference and deep learning. The primer differs from other treatments of deep learning and causal inference in its sharp focus on observational causal estimation, its extended exposition of key algorithms, and its detailed tutorials for implementing, training, and selecting among deep estimators in TensorFlow 2 and PyTorch.",

          "authors": "Miriam Hurtado Bodell, Måns Magnusson, Marc Keuschnigg",
          "abstract": "Sociologists are discussing the need for more formal ways to extract meaning from digital text archives. We focus attention on the seeded topic model, a semi-supervised extension to the standard topic model that allows sociological knowledge to be infused into the computational learning of meaning structures. Seed words help crystallize topics around known concepts, while utilizing topic models’ functionality to identify associations in text based on word co-occurrences. The method estimates a concept’s shared interpretation (or framing) via its associations with other frequently co-occurring topics. In a case study, we extract longitudinal measures of media frames regarding immigration from a vast corpus of millions of Swedish newspaper articles from the period 1945–2019. We infer turning points that partition the immigration discourse into meaningful eras and locate Sweden’s era of multicultural ideals that coined its tolerant reputation.",
