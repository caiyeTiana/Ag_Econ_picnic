          "authors": "Valentin Hofmann, Pratyusha Ria Kalluri, Dan Jurafsky, Sharese King",
          "abstract": "Hundreds of millions of people now interact with language models, with uses ranging from help with writing 1,2 to informing hiring decisions 3 . However, these language models are known to perpetuate systematic racial prejudices, making their judgements biased in problematic ways about groups such as African Americans 4–7 . Although previous research has focused on overt racism in language models, social scientists have argued that racism with a more subtle character has developed over time, particularly in the United States after the civil rights movement 8,9 . It is unknown whether this covert racism manifests in language models. Here, we demonstrate that language models embody covert racism in the form of dialect prejudice, exhibiting raciolinguistic stereotypes about speakers of African American English (AAE) that are more negative than any human stereotypes about African Americans ever experimentally recorded. By contrast, the language models’ overt stereotypes about African Americans are more positive. Dialect prejudice has the potential for harmful consequences: language models are more likely to suggest that speakers of AAE be assigned less-prestigious jobs, be convicted of crimes and be sentenced to death. Finally, we show that current practices of alleviating racial bias in language models, such as human preference alignment, exacerbate the discrepancy between covert and overt stereotypes, by superficially obscuring the racism that language models maintain on a deeper level. Our findings have far-reaching implications for the fair and safe use of language technology.",

          "abstract": "Developmental myelination is a protracted process in the mammalian brain 1 . One theory for why oligodendrocytes mature so slowly posits that myelination may stabilize neuronal circuits and temper neuronal plasticity as animals age 2–4 . We tested this theory in the visual cortex, which has a well-defined critical period for experience-dependent neuronal plasticity 5 . During adolescence, visual experience modulated the rate of oligodendrocyte maturation in visual cortex. To determine whether oligodendrocyte maturation in turn regulates neuronal plasticity, we genetically blocked oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination in adolescent mice. In adult mice lacking adolescent oligodendrogenesis, a brief period of monocular deprivation led to a significant decrease in visual cortex responses to the deprived eye, reminiscent of the plasticity normally restricted to adolescence. This enhanced functional plasticity was accompanied by a greater turnover of dendritic spines and coordinated reductions in spine size following deprivation. Furthermore, inhibitory synaptic transmission, which gates experience-dependent plasticity at the circuit level, was diminished in the absence of adolescent oligodendrogenesis. These results establish a critical role for oligodendrocytes in shaping the maturation and stabilization of cortical circuits and support the concept of developmental myelination acting as a functional brake on neuronal plasticity.",

          "abstract": "Sterile inflammation after myocardial infarction is classically credited to myeloid cells interacting with dead cell debris in the infarct zone 1,2 . Here we show that cardiomyocytes are the dominant initiators of a previously undescribed type I interferon response in the infarct borderzone. Using spatial transcriptomics analysis in mice and humans, we find that myocardial infarction induces colonies of interferon-induced cells (IFNICs) expressing interferon-stimulated genes decorating the borderzone, where cardiomyocytes experience mechanical stress, nuclear rupture and escape of chromosomal DNA. Cardiomyocyte-selective deletion of Irf3 abrogated IFNIC colonies, whereas mice lacking Irf3 in fibroblasts, macrophages, neutrophils or endothelial cells, Ccr2 -deficient mice or plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-depleted mice did not. Interferons blunted the protective matricellular programs and contractile function of borderzone fibroblasts, and increased vulnerability to pathological remodelling. In mice that died after myocardial infarction, IFNIC colonies were immediately adjacent to sites of ventricular rupture, while mice lacking IFNICs were protected from rupture and exhibited improved survival 3 . Together, these results reveal a pathological borderzone niche characterized by a cardiomyocyte-initiated innate immune response. We suggest that selective inhibition of IRF3 activation in non-immune cells could limit ischaemic cardiomyopathy while avoiding broad immunosuppression.",

          "abstract": "Spatial learning in teleost fish requires an intact telencephalon 1 , a brain region that contains putative analogues to components of the mammalian limbic system (for example, hippocampus) 2–4 . However, cells fundamental to spatial cognition in mammals—for example, place cells (PCs) 5,6 —have yet to be established in any fish species. In this study, using tracking microscopy to record brain-wide calcium activity in freely swimming larval zebrafish 7 , we compute the spatial information content 8 of each neuron across the brain. Strikingly, in every recorded animal, cells with the highest spatial specificity were enriched in the zebrafish telencephalon. These PCs form a population code of space from which we can decode the animal’s spatial location across time. By continuous recording of population-level activity, we found that the activity manifold of PCs refines and untangles over time. Through systematic manipulation of allothetic and idiothetic cues, we demonstrate that zebrafish PCs integrate multiple sources of information and can flexibly remap to form distinct spatial maps. Using analysis of neighbourhood distance between PCs across environments, we found evidence for a weakly preconfigured network in the telencephalon. The discovery of zebrafish PCs represents a step forward in our understanding of spatial cognition across species and the functional role of the early vertebrate telencephalon.",

          "abstract": "Romantic engagement can bias sensory perception. This ‘love blindness’ reflects a common behavioural principle across organisms: favouring pursuit of a coveted reward over potential risks 1 . In the case of animal courtship, such sensory biases may support reproductive success but can also expose individuals to danger, such as predation 2,3 . However, how neural networks balance the trade-off between risk and reward is unknown. Here we discover a dopamine-governed filter mechanism in male Drosophila that reduces threat perception as courtship progresses. We show that during early courtship stages, threat-activated visual neurons inhibit central courtship nodes via specific serotonergic neurons. This serotonergic inhibition prompts flies to abort courtship when they see imminent danger. However, as flies advance in the courtship process, the dopaminergic filter system reduces visual threat responses, shifting the balance from survival to mating. By recording neural activity from males as they approach mating, we demonstrate that progress in courtship is registered as dopaminergic activity levels ramping up. This dopamine signalling inhibits the visual threat detection pathway via Dop2R receptors, allowing male flies to focus on courtship when they are close to copulation. Thus, dopamine signalling biases sensory perception based on perceived goal proximity, to prioritize between competing behaviours.",

Here we uncover the mechanism by which NPY in sympathetic neurons 2,3 protects from obesity. Imaging of cleared mouse brown and white adipose tissue (BAT and WAT, respectively) established that NPY + sympathetic axons are a smaller subset that mostly maps to the perivasculature; analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing datasets identified mural cells as the main NPY-responsive cells in adipose tissues. We show that NPY sustains the proliferation of mural cells, which are a source of thermogenic adipocytes in both BAT and WAT 4–6 . We found that diet-induced obesity leads to neuropathy of NPY + axons and concomitant depletion of mural cells. This defect was replicated in mice with NPY abrogated from sympathetic neurons. The loss of NPY in sympathetic neurons whitened interscapular BAT, reducing its thermogenic ability and decreasing energy expenditure before the onset of obesity. It also caused adult-onset obesity of mice fed on a regular chow diet and rendered them more susceptible to diet-induced obesity without increasing food consumption. Our results indicate that, relative to central NPY, peripheral NPY produced by sympathetic nerves has the opposite effect on body weight by sustaining energy expenditure independently of food intake.",

Here, we quantify the carbon emissions from these fires from May to September 2023 on the basis of inverse modelling of satellite carbon monoxide observations. We find that the magnitude of the carbon emissions is 647 TgC (570–727 TgC), comparable to the annual fossil fuel emissions of large nations, with only India, China and the USA releasing more carbon per year 2 . We find that widespread hot–dry weather was a principal driver of fire spread, with 2023 being the warmest and driest year since at least 1980 3 . Although temperatures were extreme relative to the historical record, climate projections indicate that these temperatures are likely to be typical during the 2050s, even under a moderate climate mitigation scenario (shared socioeconomic pathway, SSP 2–4.5) 4 . Such conditions are likely to drive increased fire activity and suppress carbon uptake by Canadian forests, adding to concerns about the long-term durability of these forests as a carbon sink 5–8 .",

However, because species interaction data are typically habitat- and/or guild-specific, exactly how those interactions connect habitats and affect the stability and function of communities at landscape scales remains poorly understood. We combine multi-guild species interaction data (plant–pollinator and three plant–herbivore–parasitoid communities, collected from landscapes with one, two or three habitats), a field experiment and a modelling approach to show that multi-habitat landscapes support higher species and interaction evenness, more complementary species interactions and more consistent robustness to species loss. These emergent network properties drive improved pollination success in landscapes with more habitats and are not explained by simply summing component habitat webs. Linking landscape composition, through community structure, to ecosystem function, highlights mechanisms by which several contiguous habitats can support landscape-scale ecosystem services.",

          "abstract": "Mosquito-borne diseases affect hundreds of millions of people annually and disproportionately impact the developing world 1,2 . One mosquito species, Aedes aegypti , is a primary vector of viruses that cause dengue, yellow fever and Zika. The attraction of Ae. aegypti female mosquitos to humans requires integrating multiple cues, including CO 2 from breath, organic odours from skin and visual cues, all sensed at mid and long ranges, and other cues sensed at very close range 3–6 . Here we identify a cue that Ae. aegypti use as part of their sensory arsenal to find humans. We demonstrate that Ae. aegypti sense the infrared (IR) radiation emanating from their targets and use this information in combination with other cues for highly effective mid-range navigation. Detection of thermal IR requires the heat-activated channel TRPA1, which is expressed in neurons at the tip of the antenna. Two opsins are co-expressed with TRPA1 in these neurons and promote the detection of lower IR intensities. We propose that radiant energy causes local heating at the end of the antenna, thereby activating temperature-sensitive receptors in thermosensory neurons. The realization that thermal IR radiation is an outstanding mid-range directional cue expands our understanding as to how mosquitoes are exquisitely effective in locating hosts.",

The bacterial chaperonin GroEL forms juxtaposed rings that bind unfolded protein and the lid-shaped cofactor GroES at their apertures. In vitro analyses of the chaperonin reaction have shown that substrate protein folds, unimpaired by aggregation, while transiently encapsulated in the GroEL central cavity by GroES 4–6 . To determine the functional stoichiometry of GroEL, GroES and client protein in situ, here we visualized chaperonin complexes in their natural cellular environment using cryo-electron tomography. We find that, under various growth conditions, around 55–70% of GroEL binds GroES asymmetrically on one ring, with the remainder populating symmetrical complexes. Bound substrate protein is detected on the free ring of the asymmetrical complex, defining the substrate acceptor state. In situ analysis of GroEL–GroES chambers, validated by high-resolution structures obtained in vitro, showed the presence of encapsulated substrate protein in a folded state before release into the cytosol. Based on a comprehensive quantification and conformational analysis of chaperonin complexes, we propose a GroEL–GroES reaction cycle that consists of linked asymmetrical and symmetrical subreactions mediating protein folding. Our findings illuminate the native conformational and functional chaperonin cycle directly within cells.",

Despite the clinical evidence 1,5–7 , the underlying mechanisms of coagulopathy in COVID-19 and its consequences in inflammation and neuropathology remain poorly understood and treatment options are insufficient. Fibrinogen, the central structural component of blood clots, is abundantly deposited in the lungs and brains of patients with COVID-19, correlates with disease severity and is a predictive biomarker for post-COVID-19 cognitive deficits 1,5,8–10 . Here we show that fibrin binds to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, forming proinflammatory blood clots that drive systemic thromboinflammation and neuropathology in COVID-19. Fibrin, acting through its inflammatory domain, is required for oxidative stress and macrophage activation in the lungs, whereas it suppresses natural killer cells, after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Fibrin promotes neuroinflammation and neuronal loss after infection, as well as innate immune activation in the brain and lungs independently of active infection. A monoclonal antibody targeting the inflammatory fibrin domain provides protection from microglial activation and neuronal injury, as well as from thromboinflammation in the lung after infection. Thus, fibrin drives inflammation and neuropathology in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and fibrin-targeting immunotherapy may represent a therapeutic intervention for patients with acute COVID-19 and long COVID.",

However, the mechanisms by which these signalling elements are translated into defined physiological outcomes are poorly understood. Here, to study the basis for encoding of specificity in plant signal processing, we used light-gated ion channels (channelrhodopsins). We developed a genetically engineered channelrhodopsin variant called XXM 2.0 with high Ca 2+ conductance that enabled triggering cytosolic Ca 2+ elevations in planta. Plant responses to light-induced Ca 2+ influx through XXM 2.0 were studied side by side with effects caused by an anion efflux through the light-gated anion channelrhodopsin ACR1 2.0 4 . Although both tools triggered membrane depolarizations, their activation led to distinct plant stress responses: XXM 2.0-induced Ca 2+ signals stimulated production of reactive oxygen species and defence mechanisms; ACR1 2.0-mediated anion efflux triggered drought stress responses. Our findings imply that discrete Ca 2+ signals and anion efflux serve as triggers for specific metabolic and transcriptional reprogramming enabling plants to adapt to particular stress situations. Our optogenetics approach unveiled that within plant leaves, distinct physiological responses are triggered by specific ion fluxes, which are accompanied by similar electrical signals.",

Here, using a database of 67,715 newly predicted protein structures from 4,463 eukaryotic viral species, we found that 62% of viral proteins are structurally distinct and lack homologues in the AlphaFold database 2,3 . Among the remaining 38% of viral proteins, many have non-viral structural analogues that revealed surprising similarities between human pathogens and their eukaryotic hosts. Structural comparisons suggested putative functions for up to 25% of unannotated viral proteins, including those with roles in the evasion of innate immunity. In particular, RNA ligase T-like phosphodiesterases were found to resemble phage-encoded proteins that hydrolyse the host immune-activating cyclic dinucleotides 3′,3′- and 2′,3′-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP). Experimental analysis showed that RNA ligase T homologues encoded by avian poxviruses similarly hydrolyse cGAMP, showing that RNA ligase T-mediated targeting of cGAMP is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of immune evasion that is present in both bacteriophage and eukaryotic viruses. Together, the viral protein structural database and analyses presented here afford new opportunities to identify mechanisms of virus–host interactions that are common across the virome.",

          "abstract": "The brain functions as a prediction machine, utilizing an internal model of the world to anticipate sensations and the outcomes of our actions. Discrepancies between expected and actual events, referred to as prediction errors, are leveraged to update the internal model and guide our attention towards unexpected events 1–10 . Despite the importance of prediction-error signals for various neural computations across the brain, surprisingly little is known about the neural circuit mechanisms responsible for their implementation. Here we describe a thalamocortical disinhibitory circuit that is required for generating sensory prediction-error signals in mouse primary visual cortex (V1). We show that violating animals’ predictions by an unexpected visual stimulus preferentially boosts responses of the layer 2/3 V1 neurons that are most selective for that stimulus. Prediction errors specifically amplify the unexpected visual input, rather than representing non-specific surprise or difference signals about how the visual input deviates from the animal’s predictions. This selective amplification is implemented by a cooperative mechanism requiring thalamic input from the pulvinar and cortical vasoactive-intestinal-peptide-expressing (VIP) inhibitory interneurons. In response to prediction errors, VIP neurons inhibit a specific subpopulation of somatostatin-expressing inhibitory interneurons that gate excitatory pulvinar input to V1, resulting in specific pulvinar-driven response amplification of the most stimulus-selective neurons in V1. Therefore, the brain prioritizes unpredicted sensory information by selectively increasing the salience of unpredicted sensory features through the synergistic interaction of thalamic input and neocortical disinhibitory circuits.",

          "abstract": "Severe defects in human IFNγ immunity predispose individuals to both Bacillus Calmette–Guérin disease and tuberculosis, whereas milder defects predispose only to tuberculosis 1 . Here we report two adults with recurrent pulmonary tuberculosis who are homozygous for a private loss-of-function TNF variant. Neither has any other clinical phenotype and both mount normal clinical and biological inflammatory responses. Their leukocytes, including monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) do not produce TNF, even after stimulation with IFNγ. Blood leukocyte subset development is normal in these patients. However, an impairment in the respiratory burst was observed in granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-matured MDMs and alveolar macrophage-like (AML) cells 2 from both patients with TNF deficiency, TNF- or TNFR1-deficient induced pluripotent stem (iPS)-cell-derived GM-CSF-matured macrophages, and healthy control MDMs and AML cells differentiated with TNF blockers in vitro, and in lung macrophages treated with TNF blockers ex vivo. The stimulation of TNF-deficient iPS-cell-derived macrophages with TNF rescued the respiratory burst. These findings contrast with those for patients with inherited complete deficiency of the respiratory burst across all phagocytes, who are prone to multiple infections, including both Bacillus Calmette–Guérin disease and tuberculosis 3 .

          "abstract": "Crystallographic phase engineering plays an important part in the precise control of the physical and electronic properties of materials. In two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs), phase engineering using chemical lithiation with the organometallization agent n -butyllithium ( n -BuLi), to convert the semiconducting 2H (trigonal) to the metallic 1T (octahedral) phase, has been widely explored for applications in areas such as transistors, catalysis and batteries 1–15 . Although this chemical phase engineering can be performed at ambient temperatures and pressures, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, and the use of n -BuLi raises notable safety concerns. Here we optically visualize the archetypical phase transition from the 2H to the 1T phase in mono- and bilayer 2D TMDs and discover that this reaction can be accelerated by up to six orders of magnitude using low-power illumination at 455 nm. We identify that the above-gap illumination improves the rate-limiting charge-transfer kinetics through a photoredox process. We use this method to achieve rapid and high-quality phase engineering of TMDs and demonstrate that this methodology can be harnessed to inscribe arbitrary phase patterns with diffraction-limited edge resolution into few-layer TMDs. Finally, we replace pyrophoric n -BuLi with safer polycyclic aromatic organolithiation agents and show that their performance exceeds that of n -BuLi as a phase transition agent. Our work opens opportunities for exploring the in situ characterization of electrochemical processes and paves the way for sustainably scaling up materials and devices by photoredox phase engineering.",

          "abstract": "Artificial neural networks, deep-learning methods and the backpropagation algorithm 1 form the foundation of modern machine learning and artificial intelligence. These methods are almost always used in two phases, one in which the weights of the network are updated and one in which the weights are held constant while the network is used or evaluated. This contrasts with natural learning and many applications, which require continual learning. It has been unclear whether or not deep learning methods work in continual learning settings. Here we show that they do not—that standard deep-learning methods gradually lose plasticity in continual-learning settings until they learn no better than a shallow network. We show such loss of plasticity using the classic ImageNet dataset and reinforcement-learning problems across a wide range of variations in the network and the learning algorithm. Plasticity is maintained indefinitely only by algorithms that continually inject diversity into the network, such as our continual backpropagation algorithm, a variation of backpropagation in which a small fraction of less-used units are continually and randomly reinitialized. Our results indicate that methods based on gradient descent are not enough—that sustained deep learning requires a random, non-gradient component to maintain variability and plasticity.",

          "abstract": "Billions of cells are eliminated daily from our bodies 1–4 . Although macrophages and dendritic cells are dedicated to migrating and engulfing dying cells and debris, many epithelial and mesenchymal tissue cells can digest nearby apoptotic corpses 1–4 . How these non-motile, non-professional phagocytes sense and eliminate dying cells while maintaining their normal tissue functions is unclear. Here we explore the mechanisms that underlie their multifunctionality by exploiting the cyclical bouts of tissue regeneration and degeneration during hair cycling. We show that hair follicle stem cells transiently unleash phagocytosis at the correct time and place through local molecular triggers that depend on both lipids released by neighbouring apoptotic corpses and retinoids released by healthy counterparts. We trace the heart of this dual ligand requirement to RARγ–RXRα, whose activation enables tight regulation of apoptotic cell clearance genes and provides an effective, tunable mechanism to offset phagocytic duties against the primary stem cell function of preserving tissue integrity during homeostasis. Finally, we provide functional evidence that hair follicle stem cell-mediated phagocytosis is not simply redundant with professional phagocytes but rather has clear benefits to tissue fitness. Our findings have broad implications for other non-motile tissue stem or progenitor cells that encounter cell death in an immune-privileged niche.",

          "abstract": "Non-cognitive skills, such as motivation and self-regulation, are partly heritable and predict academic achievement beyond cognitive skills. However, how the relationship between non-cognitive skills and academic achievement changes over development is unclear. The current study examined how cognitive and non-cognitive skills are associated with academic achievement from ages 7 to 16 years in a sample of over 10,000 children from England and Wales. The results showed that the association between non-cognitive skills and academic achievement increased across development. Twin and polygenic scores analyses found that the links between non-cognitive genetics and academic achievement became stronger over the school years. The results from within-family analyses indicated that non-cognitive genetic effects on academic achievement could not simply be attributed to confounding by environmental differences between nuclear families, consistent with a possible role for evocative/active gene–environment correlations. By studying genetic associations through a developmental lens, we provide further insights into the role of non-cognitive skills in academic development.",

          "abstract": "Communicating the scientific consensus that human-caused climate change is real increases climate change beliefs, worry and support for public action in the United States. In this preregistered experiment, we tested two scientific consensus messages, a classic message on the reality of human-caused climate change and an updated message additionally emphasizing scientific agreement that climate change is a crisis. Across online convenience samples from 27 countries ( n = 10,527), the classic message substantially reduces misperceptions ( d = 0.47, 95% CI (0.41, 0.52)) and slightly increases climate change beliefs (from d = 0.06, 95% CI (0.01, 0.11) to d = 0.10, 95% CI (0.04, 0.15)) and worry ( d = 0.05, 95% CI (−0.01, 0.10)) but not support for public action directly. The updated message is equally effective but provides no added value. Both messages are more effective for audiences with lower message familiarity and higher misperceptions, including those with lower trust in climate scientists and right-leaning ideologies. Overall, scientific consensus messaging is an effective, non-polarizing tool for changing misperceptions, beliefs and worry across different audiences.",

          "abstract": "Achieving more sustainable adaptation to social–environmental change demands the transformation of the narratives that provide the rationale for risk governance. These narratives often reflect long-standing beliefs about social and political relationships, ascribe actions and responsibilities, and specify solutions to risk. When such solutions are implemented through material investments in landscapes, these narratives become embedded in physical infrastructure with long legacies. Dominant narratives can mask a range of divergent problem framings. By masking alternatives, narratives can contribute to the persistence of unsustainable governance trajectories. Decision-support tools have begun to represent narratives as drivers of system dynamics; making narratives visible can reveal opportunities for more sustainable governance. We present the results of the project “The Dynamics of Multi-Scalar Adaptation in the Megalopolis”, a dynamic, exploratory model of socio-hydrological risks in Mexico City that was designed to both endogenize and simultaneously challenge the dominant narratives that characterize water-risk governance in the city. Qualitative data characterize dominant narratives at city and borough scales. An agent-based model, informed by multicriteria decision analysis and coupled with hydrological, urbanization, and climatic model inputs, permitted the development of exploratory governance scenarios designed to challenge dominant narratives. Scenarios revealed how dominant narratives may contribute to the persistence of vulnerability “hotspots” in the city, despite stated goals of equity and vulnerability alleviation. Participatory workshops with representatives of the city government illustrate how making such narratives visible through exploratory modeling can lead to a questioning of prior assumptions and causal relations, recognition of a need for intersectoral collaboration, and insights into potential management strategies.",

          "abstract": "Conservationists have long argued that inadequate funding for managing protected areas (PAs) jeopardizes their ability to achieve conservation goals. However, this claim has rarely been substantiated by quantitative evaluations. To address this, we examined the impact of funding on PA effectiveness both at the scale of 17 national PA systems across Latin America and within a PA system (Ecuador), for which we had precise historical financial data. Most PAs reduced deforestation between 2000 and 2010, demonstrating their crucial role in forest conservation. However, large deficits in funding considerably reduced the effectiveness of PAs in Ecuador (on average, a unit decrease in deficit leads to a 3.07% increase in effectiveness in avoiding deforestation). While differences in effectiveness between individual PAs in Ecuador were associated with funding deficits, national-level socioeconomic metrics (e.g., the Human Development Index) were the major factor when comparing PA system-level effectiveness among countries. This result suggests that while funding plays a major role in the performance of individual PAs, the quality of the socioeconomic context at the country level is critical for the overall performance of the PA systems. We, therefore, emphasize that maximizing the effectiveness of PAs requires a multilevel approach that includes better and more strategic resource allocation for individual PAs, combined with actions for strengthening the governance and institutions that regulate PA systems.",

          "abstract": "The oxygen isotope ratio 18 O/ 16 O (expressed as a δ 18 O VSMOW value) in marine sedimentary rocks has increased by ~8‰ from the early Paleozoic to modern times. Interpretation of this trend is hindered by ambiguities in the temperature of formation of the carbonate, the δ 18 O seawater , and the effects of postdepositional diagenesis. Carbonate clumped isotope measurements, a temperature proxy, offer constraints on this problem. This thermometer is thermodynamically controlled in cases where carbonate achieves an equilibrium internal distribution of isotopes and is independent of the δ 18 O of the water from which the carbonate grew; therefore, it has a relatively rigorous chemical–physics foundation and can be applied to settings where the δ 18 O of the water is not known. We apply this technique to an exceptionally well-preserved Ordovician carbonate record from the Baltic Basin and present a framework for interpreting clumped isotope results and for reconstructing past δ 18 O seawater . We find that the seawater in the Ordovician had lower δ 18 O seawater values than previously estimated, highlighting the need to reassess climate records based on oxygen-isotopes, particularly where interpretations are based on assumptions regarding either the δ 18 O seawater or the temperature of deposition or diagenesis. We argue that an increase in δ 18 O seawater contributed to the long-term rise in the δ 18 O of marine sedimentary rocks since the early Paleozoic. This rise might have been driven by a change in the proportion of high- versus low-temperature water–rock interaction in the earth’s hydrosphere as a whole.",

          "abstract": "Winter diapause in insects is commonly terminated through cold exposure, which, like vernalization in plants, prevents development before spring arrives. Currently, quantitative understanding of the temperature dependence of diapause termination is limited, likely because diapause phenotypes are generally cryptic to human eyes. We introduce a methodology to tackle this challenge. By consecutively moving butterfly pupae of the species Pieris napi from several different cold conditions to 20 °C, we show that diapause termination proceeds as a temperature-dependent rate process, with maximal rates at relatively cold temperatures and low rates at warm and extremely cold temperatures. Further, we show that the resulting thermal reaction norm can predict P. napi diapause termination timing under variable temperatures. Last, we show that once diapause is terminated in P. napi , subsequent development follows a typical thermal performance curve, with a maximal development rate at around 31 °C and a minimum at around 2 °C. The sequence of these thermally distinct processes (diapause termination and postdiapause development) facilitates synchronous spring eclosion in nature; cold microclimates where diapause progresses quickly do not promote fast postdiapause development, allowing individuals in warmer winter microclimates to catch up, and vice versa. The unveiling of diapause termination as one temperature-dependent rate process among others promotes a parsimonious, quantitative, and predictive model, wherein winter diapause functions both as an adaptation against premature development during fall and winter and for synchrony in spring.",

          "abstract": "Gauge theories are powerful theoretical physics tools that allow complex phenomena to be reduced to simple principles and are used in both high-energy and condensed matter physics. In the latter context, gauge theories are becoming increasingly popular for capturing the intricate spin correlations in spin liquids, exotic states of matter in which the dynamics of quantum spins never ceases, even at absolute zero temperature. We consider a spin system on a three-dimensional pyrochlore lattice where emergent gauge fields not only describe the spin liquid behavior at zero temperature but crucially determine the system’s temperature evolution, with distinct gauge fields giving rise to different spin liquid phases in separate temperature regimes. Focusing first on classical spins, in an intermediate temperature regime, the system shows an unusual coexistence of emergent vector and tensor gauge fields where the former is known from classical spin ice systems while the latter has been associated with fractonic quasiparticles, a peculiar type of excitation with restricted mobility. Upon cooling, the system transitions into a low-temperature phase where an entropic selection mechanism depopulates the degrees of freedom associated with the tensor gauge field, rendering the system spin-ice-like. We further provide numerical evidence that in the corresponding quantum model, a spin liquid with coexisting vector and tensor gauge fields has a finite window of stability in the parameter space of spin interactions down to zero temperature. Finally, we discuss the relevance of our findings for non-Kramers magnetic pyrochlore materials.",

          "abstract": "Learning and memory require coordinated structural and functional plasticity at neuronal glutamatergic synapses located on dendritic spines. Here, we investigated how the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) controls postsynaptic Ca 2+ signaling and long-term potentiation of dendritic spine size, i.e., sLTP that accompanies functional strengthening of glutamatergic synaptic transmission. In most ER-containing (ER+) spines, high-frequency optical glutamate uncaging (HFGU) induced long-lasting sLTP that was accompanied by a persistent increase in spine ER content downstream of a signaling cascade engaged by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), L-type Ca 2+ channels (LTCCs), and Orai1 channels, the latter being activated by stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) in response to ER Ca 2+ release. In contrast, HFGU stimulation of ER-lacking (ER−) spines expressed only transient sLTP and exhibited weaker Ca 2+ signals noticeably lacking Orai1 and ER contributions. Consistent with spine ER regulating structural metaplasticity, delivery of a second stimulus to ER− spines induced ER recruitment along with persistent sLTP, whereas ER+ spines showed no additional increases in size or ER content in response to sequential stimulation. Surprisingly, the physical interaction between STIM1 and Orai1 induced by ER Ca 2+ release, but not the resulting Ca 2+ entry through Orai1 channels, proved necessary for the persistent increases in both spine size and ER content required for expression of long-lasting late sLTP.",

Understanding the psychological and neurobiological processes producing religious fundamentalism may inform a variety of scientific, sociological, and cultural questions. Research indicates that brain damage can alter religious fundamentalism. However, the precise brain regions involved with these changes remain unknown. Here, we analyzed brain lesions associated with varying levels of religious fundamentalism in two large datasets from independent laboratories. Lesions associated with greater fundamentalism were connected to a specific brain network with nodes in the right orbitofrontal, dorsolateral prefrontal, and inferior parietal lobe. This fundamentalism network was strongly right hemisphere lateralized and highly reproducible across the independent datasets ( r = 0.82) with cross-validations between datasets. To explore the relationship of this network to lesions previously studied by our group, we tested for similarities to twenty-one lesion-associated conditions. Lesions associated with confabulation and criminal behavior showed a similar connectivity pattern as lesions associated with greater fundamentalism. Moreover, lesions associated with poststroke pain showed a similar connectivity pattern as lesions associated with lower fundamentalism. These findings are consistent with the current understanding of hemispheric specializations for reasoning and lend insight into previously observed epidemiological associations with fundamentalism, such as cognitive rigidity and outgroup hostility.",

By integrating genetic techniques with classification models, this comprehensive approach identified candidate genes on chromosome 2 ( qGI2.1/qAC2.1 spanning the region from 18.62 Mb to 19.95 Mb), exerting influence on low GI and high amylose. Notably, the phenotypic variant with high value was associated with the recessive allele of the starch branching enzyme 2b ( sbeIIb ). The genome-edited sbeIIb line confirmed low GI phenotype in milled rice grains. Further, combinations of alleles created by the highly significant SNPs from the targeted associations and epistatically interacting genes showed ultralow GI phenotypes with high amylose and high protein. Metabolomics analysis of rice with varying AC, PC, and GI revealed that the superior lines of high AC and PC, and low GI were preferentially enriched in glycolytic and amino acid metabolisms, whereas the inferior lines of low AC and PC and high GI were enriched with fatty acid metabolism. The high amylose high protein recombinant inbred line (HAHP_101) was enriched in essential amino acids like lysine.

However, pathogenic mechanisms leading to glaucoma-induced RGC loss are incompletely understood. Unexpectedly, we found that cGAS–STING (2′3′-cyclic GMP-AMP–stimulator of interferon genes) signaling, which surveils displaced double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in the cytosol and initiates innate immune responses, was robustly activated during glaucoma in retinal microglia in distinct murine models. Global or microglial deletion of STING markedly relieved glaucoma symptoms and protected RGC degeneration and vision loss, while mice bearing genetic cGAS–STING supersensitivity aggravated retinal neuroinflammation and RGC loss. Mechanistically, dsDNA from tissue injury activated microglial cGAS–STING signaling, causing deleterious macroglia reactivity in retinas by cytokine-mediated microglia–macroglia interactions, progressively driving apoptotic death of RGCs. Remarkably, preclinical investigations of targeting cGAS–STING signaling by intraocular injection of TBK1i or anti-IFNAR1 antibody prevented glaucoma-induced losses of RGCs and vision. Therefore, we unravel an essential role of cGAS–STING signaling underlying glaucoma pathogenesis and suggest promising therapeutic strategies for treating this devastating disease.",

          "abstract": "Excitons are the neutral quasiparticles that form when Coulomb interactions create bound states between electrons and holes. Due to their bosonic nature, excitons are expected to condense and exhibit superfluidity at sufficiently low temperatures. In interacting Chern insulators, excitons may inherit the nontrivial topology and quantum geometry from the underlying electron wavefunctions. We theoretically investigate the excitonic bound states and superfluidity in flat-band insulators pumped with light. We find that the exciton wavefunctions exhibit vortex structures in momentum space, with the total vorticity being equal to the difference of Chern numbers between the conduction and valence bands. Moreover, both the exciton binding energy and the exciton superfluid density are proportional to the Brillouin-zone average of the quantum metric and the Coulomb potential energy per unit cell. Spontaneous emission of circularly polarized light from radiative decay is a detectable signature of the exciton vorticity. We propose that the vorticity can also be experimentally measured via the nonlinear anomalous Hall effect, whereas the exciton superfluidity can be detected by voltage-drop quantization through a combination of quantum geometry and Aharonov–Casher effect. Topological excitons and their superfluid phase could be realized in flat bands of twisted Van der Waals heterostructures.",

          "abstract": "The incidence of dengue virus disease has increased globally across the past half-century, with highest number of cases ever reported in 2019 and again in 2023. We analyzed climatological, epidemiological, and phylogenomic data to investigate drivers of two decades of dengue in Cambodia, an understudied endemic setting. Using epidemiological models fit to a 19-y dataset, we first demonstrate that climate-driven transmission alone is insufficient to explain three epidemics across the time series. We then use wavelet decomposition to highlight enhanced annual and multiannual synchronicity in dengue cycles between provinces in epidemic years, suggesting a role for climate in homogenizing dynamics across space and time. Assuming reported cases correspond to symptomatic secondary infections, we next use an age-structured catalytic model to estimate a declining force of infection for dengue through time, which elevates the mean age of reported cases in Cambodia. Reported cases in &gt;70-y-old individuals in the 2019 epidemic are best explained when also allowing for waning multitypic immunity and repeat symptomatic infections in older patients. We support this work with phylogenetic analysis of 192 dengue virus (DENV) genomes that we sequenced between 2019 and 2022, which document emergence of DENV-2 Cosmopolitan Genotype-II into Cambodia. This lineage demonstrates phylogenetic homogeneity across wide geographic areas, consistent with invasion behavior and in contrast to high phylogenetic diversity exhibited by endemic DENV-1. Finally, we simulate an age-structured, mechanistic model of dengue dynamics to demonstrate how expansion of an antigenically distinct lineage that evades preexisting multitypic immunity effectively reproduces the older-age infections witnessed in our data.",

However, a deprotonated lysine and its molecular interactions have not been directly experimentally detected. Here, we demonstrate a deprotonated lysine stably serving as an “acceptor” in a H-bond between the photosensor protein RcaE and its chromophore. Signal splitting and trans-H-bond J coupling observed by NMR spectroscopy provide direct evidence that Lys261 is deprotonated and serves as a H-bond acceptor for the chromophore NH group. Quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical calculations also indicate that this H-bond exists stably. Interestingly, the sidechain amino group of the lysine can act as both donor and acceptor. The remarkable shift in the H-bond characteristics arises from a decrease in solvation, triggered by photoisomerization. Our results provide insights into the dual role of this lysine. This mechanism has broad implications for other biological reactions in which lysine plays a role.",

This study explored the contribution of NAT10-mediated messenger RNA (mRNA) acetylation in cognitive dysfunction associated with SAE, utilizing a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced SAE mouse model. Our findings demonstrate that CLP significantly upregulates NAT10 expression and mRNA acetylation in the excitatory neurons of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). Notably, neuronal-specific Nat10 knockdown improved cognitive function in septic mice, highlighting its critical role in SAE. Proteomic analysis, RNA immunoprecipitation, and real-time qPCR identified GABA B R1 as a key downstream target of NAT10. Nat10 deletion reduced GABA B R1 expression, and subsequently weakened inhibitory postsynaptic currents in hippocampal DG neurons. Further analysis revealed that microglia activation and the release of inflammatory mediators lead to the increased NAT10 expression in neurons. Microglia depletion with PLX3397 effectively reduced NAT10 and GABA B R1 expression in neurons, and ameliorated cognitive dysfunction induced by SAE. In summary, our findings revealed that after CLP, NAT10 in hippocampal DG neurons promotes GABA B R1 expression through mRNA acetylation, leading to cognitive dysfunction.",

SlCPK27 interacts with and phosphorylates SlPIF4 at Ser-252 and Ser-308 phosphosites to promote its degradation. SlPIF4 promotes hypocotyl elongation mainly by activating the transcription of SlDWF , a key gene in brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis. Such a SlHY5-SlCPK27-SlPIF4-BR cascade not only plays a crucial role in photomorphogenesis but also regulates thermomorphogenesis.

Expanding on Sridharan et al.’s [ Neuron 55 , 521–532 (2007)] work on coarse musical boundaries between symphonic movements, we examined finer-grained boundaries. We measured the fMRI responses of 18 musicians and 18 nonmusicians during music listening.

In this study, we formulated a vaccine containing a highly conserved moonlighting protein, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex E2 subunit (PDHC), and showed that it induced strong protective immunity against epidemiologically relevant staphylococcal strains in various murine disease models. While antibody responses contributed to bacterial control, they were not essential for protective immunity in the bloodstream infection model. Conversely, vaccine-induced systemic immunity relied on γδ T cells. It has been suggested that prior S. aureus exposure may contribute to the reduction of vaccine efficacy. However, PDHC-induced protective immunity still facilitated bacterial clearance in mice previously exposed to S. aureus . Collectively, our findings indicate that PDHC is a promising serotype-independent vaccine candidate effective against both methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates.",

However, the molecular regulation of nutrient transport from endosymbiont to host is not well understood. Here, we used bioinformatic analysis, RNA-Sequencing, luciferase assays, RNA immunoprecipitation, and in situ hybridization to show that a bacteriocyte-distributed MRP4 gene (multidrug resistance-associated protein 4) is negatively regulated by a host (aphid)-specific microRNA (miR-3024). Targeted metabolomics, microbiome analysis, vitamin B6 (VB6) supplements, 3D modeling/molecular docking, in vitro binding assays (voltage clamp recording and microscale thermophoresis), and functional complementation of Escherichia coli were jointly used to show that the miR-3024/ MRP4 axis controls endosymbiont ( Serratia )-produced VB6 transport to the host. The supplementation of miR-3024 increased the mortality of aphids, but partial rescue was achieved by providing an external source of VB6. The use of miR-3024 as part of a sustainable aphid pest-control strategy was evaluated by safety assessments in nontarget organisms (pollinators, predators, and entomopathogenic fungi) using virus-induced gene silencing assays and the expression of miR-3024 in transgenic tobacco. The supplementation of miR-3024 suppresses MRP4 expression, restricting the number of membrane channels, inhibiting VB6 transport, and ultimately killing the host. Under aphids facing stress conditions, the endosymbiont titer is decreased, and the VB6 production is also down-regulated, while the aphid’s autonomous inhibition of miR-3024 enhances the expression of MRP4 and then increases the VB6 transport which finally ensures the VB6 homeostasis. The results confirm that miR-3024 regulates nutrient transport in the endosymbiont–host system and is a suitable target for sustainable pest control.",

Focusing on FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), key guardians of immune tolerance, we combined single-cell chromatin accessibility, machine learning, and high-density genetic variation, to resolve a validated framework of diverse Treg chromatin programs, each shaped by multi-TF inputs. This framework identified previously unrecognized Treg controllers ( Smarcc1 ) and illuminated the mechanism of action of FoxP3, which amplified a pre-existing Treg identity, diversely activating or repressing distinct programs, dependent on different regulatory partners. Treg subpopulations in the colon relied variably on FoxP3, Helios+ Tregs being completely dependent, but RORγ+ Tregs largely independent. These differences were rooted in intrinsic biases decoded by the integrated framework. Moving beyond master regulators, this work unravels how overlapping TF activities coalesce into Treg identity and diversity.",

In the context of physical networks, such as biological neural networks, vascular networks, or network liquids where the nodes and edges occupy volume in three-dimensional space, the question of how they become densely packed is of special importance. Here, we investigate a model network liquid, which is known to densify via two successive liquid–liquid phase transitions (LLPTs). We elucidate the importance of rings—cyclic paths formed by bonded particles in the networks—and their spatial disposition in understanding the structural changes that underpin the increase in density across the LLPTs. Our analyses demonstrate that the densification of these networks is primarily driven by the formation of linked rings, and the LLPTs correspond to a hierarchy of topological transitions where rings form the fundamental building blocks. We envisage entanglement to emerge as a general mechanism for densification, with wide implications for the embedding of physical networks, especially in confined spaces.",

For instance, female childhood cancer survivors who have undergone cranial radiation therapy (CRT) tend to display more pronounced cognitive deficits than their male counterparts. Sex effects can be the result of sex chromosome complement (XX vs. XY) and/or gonadal hormone influence. The contributions of each can be separated using the four-core genotype mouse model (FCG), where sex chromosome complement and gonadal sex are decoupled. While studies of FCG mice have evaluated brain differences in adulthood, it is still unclear how sex chromosome and sex hormone effects emerge through development in both healthy and pathological contexts. Our study utilizes longitudinal MRI with the FCG model to investigate sex effects in healthy development and after CRT in wildtype and immune-modified Ccl2 -knockout mice. Our findings in normally developing mice reveal a relatively prominent chromosome effect prepubertally, compared to sex hormone effects which largely emerge later. Spatially, sex chromosome and hormone influences were independent of one another. After CRT in Ccl2 -knockout mice, both male chromosomes and male hormones similarly improved brain outcomes but did so more separately than in combination. Our findings highlight the crucial role of sex chromosomes in early development and identify roles for sex chromosomes and hormones after CRT-induced inflammation, highlighting the influences of biological sex in both normal brain development and pathology.",

          "abstract": "To efficiently yet reliably represent and process information, our brains need to produce information-rich signals that differentiate between moments or cognitive states, while also being robust to noise or corruption. For many, though not all, natural systems, these two properties are often inversely related: More information-rich signals are less robust, and vice versa. Here, we examined how these properties change with ongoing cognitive demands. To this end, we applied dimensionality reduction algorithms and pattern classifiers to functional neuroimaging data collected as participants listened to a story, temporally scrambled versions of the story, or underwent a resting state scanning session. We considered two primary aspects of the neural data recorded in these different experimental conditions. First, we treated the maximum achievable decoding accuracy across participants as an indicator of the “informativeness” of the recorded patterns. Second, we treated the number of features (components) required to achieve a threshold decoding accuracy as a proxy for the “compressibility” of the neural patterns (where fewer components indicate greater compression). Overall, we found that the peak decoding accuracy (achievable without restricting the numbers of features) was highest in the intact (unscrambled) story listening condition. However, the number of features required to achieve comparable classification accuracy was also lowest in the intact story listening condition. Taken together, our work suggests that our brain networks flexibly reconfigure according to ongoing task demands and that the activity patterns associated with higher-order cognition and high engagement are both more informative and more compressible than the activity patterns associated with lower-order tasks and lower engagement.",

Both wheat and cotton likely spread through trans-Saharan trade networks that laid the foundation for later European trade systems. Forty-eight (48) grains of free-threshing wheat ( Triticum aestivum/durum ) represent the largest assemblage of wheat recovered in sub-Saharan West Africa, which is surprising given that wheat cannot be cultivated locally. Larger quantities of cotton ( Gossypium sp.) recovered from late 12th- to early 13th-century CE contexts suggest earlier and more widespread use than wheat.

          "abstract": "Many chronic inflammatory diseases are attributed to disturbances in host–microbe interactions, which drive immune-mediated tissue damage. Depending on the anatomic setting, a chronic inflammatory disease can exert unique local and systemic influences, which provide an exceptional opportunity for understanding disease mechanism and testing therapeutic interventions. The oral cavity is an easily accessible environment that allows for protective interventions aiming at modulating the immune response to control disease processes driven by a breakdown of host–microbe homeostasis. Periodontal disease (PD) is a prevalent condition in which quantitative and qualitative changes of the oral microbiota (dysbiosis) trigger nonresolving chronic inflammation, progressive bone loss, and ultimately tooth loss. Here, we demonstrate the therapeutic benefit of local sustained delivery of the myeloid-recruiting chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) in murine ligature-induced PD using clinically relevant models as a preventive, interventional, or reparative therapy. Local delivery of CCL2 into the periodontium inhibited bone loss and accelerated bone gain that could be ascribed to reduced osteoclasts numbers. CCL2 treatment up-regulated M2-macrophage and downregulated proinflammatory and pro-osteoclastic markers. Furthermore, single-cell ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing indicated that CCL2 therapy reversed disease-associated transcriptomic profiles of murine gingival macrophages via inhibiting the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) signaling in classically activated macrophages and inducing protein kinase A (PKA) signaling in infiltrating macrophages. Finally, 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequencing showed mitigation of microbial dysbiosis in the periodontium that correlated with a reduction in microbial load in CCL2-treated mice. This study reveals a novel protective effect of CCL2 local delivery in PD as a model for chronic inflammatory diseases caused by a disturbance in host–microbe homeostasis.",

          "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. KRAS oncogenes are responsible for at least a quarter of lung adenocarcinomas, the main subtype of lung cancer. After four decades of intense research, selective inhibitors of KRAS oncoproteins are finally reaching the clinic. Yet, their effect on overall survival is limited due to the rapid appearance of drug resistance, a likely consequence of the high intratumoral heterogeneity characteristic of these tumors. In this study, we have attempted to identify those functional alterations that result from KRAS oncoprotein expression during the earliest stages of tumor development. Such functional changes are likely to be maintained during the entire process of tumor progression regardless of additional co-occurring mutations. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of murine alveolar type 2 cells expressing a resident Kras oncogene revealed impairment of the type I interferon pathway, a feature maintained throughout tumor progression. This alteration was also present in advanced murine and human tumors harboring additional mutations in the p53 or LKB1 tumor suppressors. Restoration of type I interferon (IFN) signaling by IFN-β or constitutive active stimulator of interferon genes (STING) expression had a profound influence on the tumor microenvironment, switching them from immunologically “cold” to immunologically “hot” tumors. Therefore, enhancement of the type I IFN pathway predisposes KRAS mutant lung tumors to immunotherapy treatments, regardless of co-occurring mutations in p53 or LKB1.",

          "abstract": "The nature of microRNA (miRNA) dysfunction in carcinogenesis remains controversial because of the complex connection between miRNA structural diversity and biological processes. Here, we found that oncofetal IGF2BP3 regulates the selective production of a subset of 3′-isoforms (3′-isomiRs), including miR-21-5p and Let-7 family, which induces significant changes in their cellular seed occupancy and structural components, establishing a cancer-specific gene expression profile. The D-score, reflecting dominant production of a representative miR-21-5p+C (a 3′-isomiR), discriminated between clinical early-stage lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cases with low and high recurrence risks, and was associated with molecular features of cell cycle progression, epithelial–mesenchymal transition pressure, and immune evasion. We found that IGF2BP3 controls the production of miR-21-5p+C by directing the nuclear Drosha complex to select the cleavage site. IGF2BP3 was also involved in the production of 3′-isomiRs of miR-425-5p and miR-454-3p. IGF2BP3-regulated these three miRNAs are suggested to be associated with the regulation of p53, TGF-β, and TNF pathways in LUAD. Knockdown of IGF2BP3 also induced a selective upregulation of Let-7 3′-isomiRs, leading to increased cellular Let-7 seed occupancy and broad repression of its target genes encoding cell cycle regulators. The D-score is an index that reflects this cellular situation. Our results suggest that the aberrant regulation of miRNA structural diversity is a critical component for controlling cellular networks, thus supporting the establishment of a malignant gene expression profile in early stage LUAD.",

          "abstract": "Inhibitors of heterotrimeric G proteins are being developed as therapeutic agents. Epitomizing this approach are YM-254890 (YM) and FR900359 (FR), which are efficacious in models of thrombosis, hypertension, obesity, asthma, uveal melanoma, and pain, and under investigation as an FR-antibody conjugate in uveal melanoma clinical trials. YM/FR inhibits the Gq/11/14 subfamily by interfering with GDP (guanosine diphosphate) release, but by an unknown biophysical mechanism. Here, we show that YM inhibits GDP release by stabilizing closure between the Ras-like and α-helical domains of a Gα subunit. Nucleotide-free Gα adopts an ensemble of open and closed configurations, as indicated by single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer and molecular dynamics simulations, whereas GDP and GTPγS (guanosine 5’-O-[gamma-thio]triphosphate) stabilize distinct closed configurations. YM stabilizes closure in the presence or absence of GDP without requiring an intact interdomain interface. All three classes of mammalian Gα subunits that are insensitive to YM/FR possess homologous but degenerate YM/FR binding sites, yet can be inhibited upon transplantation of the YM/FR binding site of Gq. Novel YM/FR analogs tailored to each class of G protein will provide powerful new tools for therapeutic investigation.",

Each event of meiosis must occur at the correct developmental stage to ensure that chromosomes are segregated properly during both meiotic divisions. One unique meiosis-specific structure that is tightly regulated in terms of timing of assembly and disassembly is the synaptonemal complex (SC). While the mechanism(s) for assembly and disassembly of the SC are poorly understood in Drosophila melanogaster , posttranslational modifications, including ubiquitination and phosphorylation, are known to play a role. Here, we identify a role for the deubiquitinase Usp7 in the maintenance of the SC in early prophase and show that its function in SC maintenance is independent of the meiotic recombination process. Using two usp7 shRNA constructs that result in different knockdown levels, we have shown that the presence of SC through early/mid-pachytene is critical for normal levels and placement of crossovers.",

Here, we used single-molecule imaging in reconstituted morphogen gradients and in tissue explants to determine that Hedgehog diffused extracellularly as a monomer, and rapidly transitioned between membrane-confined and -unconfined states. Unexpectedly, the vertebrate-specific protein SCUBE1 expanded Hedgehog gradients by accelerating the transition rates between states without affecting the relative abundance of molecules in each state. This observation could not be explained under existing models of morphogen diffusion. Instead, we developed a topology-limited diffusion model in which cell–cell gaps create diffusion barriers, which morphogens can only overcome by passing through a membrane-unconfined state. Under this model, SCUBE1 promoted Hedgehog secretion and diffusion by allowing it to transiently overcome diffusion barriers. This multiscale understanding of morphogen gradient formation unified prior models and identified knobs that nature can use to tune morphogen gradient sizes across tissues and organisms.",

          "abstract": "Genomic information must be faithfully transmitted into two daughter cells during mitosis. To ensure the transmission process, interphase chromatin is further condensed into mitotic chromosomes. Although protein factors like condensins and topoisomerase IIα are involved in the assembly of mitotic chromosomes, the physical bases of the condensation process remain unclear. Depletion attraction/macromolecular crowding, an effective attractive force that arises between large structures in crowded environments around chromosomes, may contribute to the condensation process. To approach this issue, we investigated the “chromosome milieu” during mitosis of living human cells using an orientation-independent-differential interference contrast module combined with a confocal laser scanning microscope, which is capable of precisely mapping optical path differences and estimating molecular densities. We found that the molecular density surrounding chromosomes increased with the progression from prophase to anaphase, concurring with chromosome condensation. However, the molecular density went down in telophase, when chromosome decondensation began. Changes in the molecular density around chromosomes by hypotonic or hypertonic treatment consistently altered the condensation levels of chromosomes. In vitro, native chromatin was converted into liquid droplets of chromatin in the presence of cations and a macromolecular crowder. Additional crowder made the chromatin droplets stiffer and more solid-like. These results suggest that a transient rise in depletion attraction, likely triggered by the relocation of macromolecules (proteins, RNAs, and others) via nuclear envelope breakdown and by a subsequent decrease in cell volumes, contributes to mitotic chromosome condensation, shedding light on a different aspect of the condensation mechanism in living human cells.",

In the nervous system, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have essential neuromodulatory functions through binding extracellular ligands to induce intracellular signaling cascades. In this work, we develop and validate an optogenetic tool that disrupts Gα q signaling through membrane recruitment of a minimal regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) domain. This approach, Photo-induced Gα Modulator—Inhibition of Gα q (PiGM-Iq), exhibited potent and selective inhibition of Gα q signaling. Using PiGM-Iq we alter the behavior of Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila with outcomes consistent with GPCR-Gα q disruption. PiGM-Iq changes axon guidance in cultured dorsal root ganglia neurons in response to serotonin. PiGM-Iq activation leads to developmental deficits in zebrafish embryos and larvae resulting in altered neuronal wiring and behavior. Furthermore, by altering the minimal RGS domain, we show that this approach is amenable to Gα i signaling. Our unique and robust optogenetic Gα inhibiting approaches complement existing neurobiological tools and can be used to investigate the functional effects neuromodulators that signal through GPCR and trimeric G proteins.",

However, evidence of concordant eco-evolutionary dynamics often comes from in vitro studies of highly simplified communities, and measures of ecological and evolutionary dynamics are rarely directly comparable. Here, we quantified how ecological species sorting and rapid evolution simultaneously shape community trait distributions by tracking within- and between-species changes in a key trait in a complex bacterial community. We focused on the production of siderophores; bacteria use these costly secreted metabolites to scavenge poorly soluble iron and to detoxify environments polluted with toxic nonferrous metals. We found that responses to copper-imposed selection within and between species were ultimately the same—intermediate siderophore levels were favored—and occurred over similar timescales. Despite being a social trait, this level of siderophore production was selected regardless of whether species evolved in isolation or in a community context. Our study suggests that evolutionary selection can play a pivotal role in shaping community trait distributions within natural, highly complex, bacterial communities. Furthermore, trait evolution may not always be qualitatively affected by interactions with other community members.",

          "abstract": "Protein phosphatase-1 catalytic subunit (PP1) joins diverse targeting subunits to form holophosphatases that regulate many cellular processes. Newly synthesized PP1 is known to be transiently sequestered in an inhibitory complex with Suppressor-of-Dis2-number-2 (SDS22) and Inhibitor-3 (I3), which is disassembled by the ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities plus (AAA+) protein p97. Here, we show that the SDS22-PP1-I3 complex also acts as a thermodynamic sink for mature PP1 and that cycles of SDS22-PP1-I3 formation and p97-driven disassembly regulate PP1 function and subunit exchange beyond PP1 biogenesis. Förster Resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis of labeled proteins in vitro revealed that in the p97-mediated disassembly step, both SDS22 and I3 dissociate concomitantly, releasing PP1. In presence of a targeting subunit, for instance Growth Arrest and DNA Damage-inducible protein 34 (GADD34), liberated PP1 formed an active holophosphatase that dephosphorylated its substrate, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α). Inhibition of p97 results in displacement of the GADD34 targeting subunit by rebinding of PP1 to SDS22 and I3 indicating that the SDS22-PP1-I3 complex is thermodynamically favored. Likewise, p97 inhibition in cells causes rapid sequestration of PP1 by free SDS22 and I3 at the expense of other subunits. This suggests that PP1 exists in a steady state maintained by spontaneous SDS22-PP1-I3 formation and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis, p97-driven disassembly that recycles active PP1 between different holophosphatase complexes to warrant a dynamic holophosphatase landscape.",

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a key component of cancer-derived immune suppression; however, these lymphocytes are necessary to prevent systemic autoimmunity in mice and humans, and thus, direct targeting of Tregs is not a clinical option for cancer patients. We have previously demonstrated that excising transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 2 ( Klf2 ) within the T cell lineage blocks the generation of peripheral-derived Tregs (pTregs) without impairing production of thymic-derived Tregs. Using this mouse model, we have now demonstrated that eliminating pTregs is sufficient to delay/prevent tumor malignancy without causing autoimmunity. Cancer-bearing mice that expressed KLF2 converted tumor-specific CD4 + T cells into pTregs, which accumulated in secondary lymphoid organs and impaired further T cell effector activity. In contrast, pTreg-deficient mice retained cancer-specific immunity, including improved T cell infiltration into “cold” tumors, reduced T cell exhaustion in tumor beds, restricted generation of tumor-associated myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and the continued production of circulating effector T cells that arose in a cancer-dependent manner. Results indicate that tumor-specific pTregs are critical for early stages of cancer progression and blocking the generation of these inhibitory lymphocytes safely delays/prevents malignancy in preclinical models of melanoma and prostate cancer.",

Despite their implications for sexual and reproductive health, sialidases from other vaginal bacteria have not been characterized. Here, we show that vaginal Prevotella species produce sialidases that possess variable activity toward mucin substrates. The sequences of sialidase genes and their presence are largely conserved across clades of Prevotella from different geographies, hinting at their importance globally. Finally, we find that Prevotella sialidase genes and transcripts, including those encoding mucin-degrading sialidases from Prevotella timonensis , are highly prevalent and abundant in human vaginal genomes and transcriptomes. Together, our results identify Prevotella as a critical source of sialidases in the vaginal microbiome, improving our understanding of this detrimental bacterial activity.",

There is a need to mimic autonomous signaling between compartments, which in living cells, is often regulated at the genetic level within the nucleus. This advancement is key to unlocking the potential of synthetic cells as cell models and as microdevices in biotechnology. However, a technological bottleneck exists preventing the creation of synthetic cells with a defined nucleus-like compartment capable of genetically programmed intercompartment signaling events.

Further comprehensive investigations of the genetic background and in-depth assessments of the conservation status of wild populations are still necessary and urgently needed. Here, we sequenced the genomes of 612 giant pandas with an average depth of ~26× and generated a high-resolution map of genomic variation with more than 20 million variants covering wild individuals from six mountain ranges and captive representatives in China. We identified distinct genetic clusters within the Minshan population by performing a fine-grained genetic structure. The estimation of inbreeding and genetic load associated with historical population dynamics suggested that future conservation efforts should pay special attention to the Qinling and Liangshan populations. Releasing captive individuals with a genetic background similar to the recipient population appears to be an advantageous genetic rescue strategy for recovering the wild giant panda populations, as this approach introduces fewer deleterious mutations into the wild population than mating with differentiated lineages. These findings emphasize the superiority of large-scale population genomics to provide precise guidelines for future conservation of the giant panda.",

          "abstract": "X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is an epigenetic process that results in the transcriptional silencing of one X chromosome in the somatic cells of females. This phenomenon is common to both eutherian and marsupial mammals, but there are fundamental differences. In eutherians, the X chosen for silencing is random. DNA methylation on the eutherian inactive X is high at transcription start sites (TSSs) and their flanking regions, resulting in universally high DNA methylation. This contrasts XCI in marsupials where the paternally derived X is always silenced, and in which DNA methylation is low at TSSs and flanking regions. Here, we examined the DNA methylation status of the tammar wallaby X chromosome during spermatogenesis to determine the DNA methylation profile of the paternal X prior to and at fertilization. Whole genome enzymatic methylation sequencing was carried out on enriched flow-sorted populations of premeiotic, meiotic, and postmeiotic cells. We observed that the X displayed a pattern of DNA methylation from spermatogonia to mature sperm that reflected the inactive X in female somatic tissue. Therefore, the paternal X chromosome arrives at the egg with a DNA methylation profile that reflects the transcriptionally silent X in adult female somatic tissue. We present this epigenetic signature as a candidate for the long sought-after imprint for paternal XCI in marsupials.",

In addition to having fewer infected cells resulting in fewer cells with HIV RNA, it is possible that lower levels of plasma viremia in controllers are due to a lower fraction of the infected cells having HIV-1 unspliced RNA (HIV usRNA) compared with NC. To directly test this possibility, we used sensitive and quantitative single-cell sequencing methods to compare the fraction of infected cells that contain one or more copies of HIV usRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from controllers and NC. The fraction of infected cells containing HIV usRNA did not differ between the two groups. Rather, the levels of viremia were strongly associated with the total number of infected cells that had HIV usRNA, as reported by others, with controllers having 34-fold fewer infected cells per million PBMC. These results reveal that viremic control is not associated with a lower fraction of proviruses expressing HIV usRNA, unlike what is reported for elite controllers, but is only related to having fewer infected cells overall, maybe reflecting greater immune clearance of infected cells.

In orientationally ordered soft matter system, three-dimensional director solitons exemplify the localized distortion of molecular orientation. However, their precise manipulation remains challenging due to unpredictable and uncontrolled generation. Here, we utilize preimposed programmable photopatterning in nematics to control the kinetics of director solitons. This enables both unidirectional and bidirectional generation at specific locations and times, confinement within micron-scaled patterns of diverse shapes, and directed propagation along predefined trajectories. A focused dynamical model provides insight into the origins of these solitons and aligns closely with experimental observations, underscoring the pivotal role of anchoring conditions in soliton manipulation.

          "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cells surrender organelles during differentiation, leaving mature red blood cells (RBC) devoid of transcriptional machinery and mitochondria. The resultant absence of cellular repair capacity limits RBC circulatory longevity, and old cells are removed from circulation. The specific age-dependent alterations required for this apparently targeted removal of RBC, however, remain elusive. Here, we assessed the function of Piezo1, a stretch-activated transmembrane cation channel, within subpopulations of RBC isolated based on physical properties associated with aging. We subsequently investigated the potential role of Piezo1 in RBC removal, using pharmacological and mechanobiological approaches. Dense (old) RBC were separated from whole blood using differential density centrifugation. Tolerance of RBC to mechanical forces within the physiological range was assessed on single-cell and cell population levels. Expression and function of Piezo1 were investigated in separated RBC populations by monitoring accumulation of cytosolic Ca 2+ and changes in cell morphology in response to pharmacological Piezo1 stimulation and in response to physical forces. Despite decreased Piezo1 activity with increasing cell age, tolerance to prolonged Piezo1 stimulation declined sharply in older RBC, precipitating lysis. Cell lysis was immediately preceded by an acute reversal of density. We propose a Piezo1-dependent mechanism by which RBC may be removed from circulation: Upon adherence of these RBC to other tissues, they are uniquely exposed to prolonged mechanical forces. The resultant sustained activation of Piezo1 leads to a net influx of Ca 2+ , overpowering the Ca 2+ -removal capacity of specifically old RBC, which leads to reversal of ion gradients, dysregulated cell hydration, and ultimately osmotic lysis.",

We therefore wondered whether aminoacylated RNAs might have served some primordial function prior to their role in protein synthesis. Here, we show that specific RNA sequences can be nonenzymatically aminoacylated and ligated to produce amino acid–bridged stem-loop RNAs. We used deep sequencing to identify RNAs that undergo highly efficient glycine aminoacylation followed by loop-closing ligation. The crystal structure of one such glycine-bridged RNA hairpin reveals a compact internally stabilized structure with the same eponymous T-loop architecture that is found in many noncoding RNAs, including the modern tRNA. We demonstrate that the T-loop-assisted amino acid bridging of RNA oligonucleotides enables the rapid template-free assembly of a chimeric version of an aminoacyl-RNA synthetase ribozyme. We suggest that the primordial assembly of amino acid–bridged chimeric ribozymes provides a direct and facile route for the covalent incorporation of amino acids into RNA. A greater functionality of covalently incorporated amino acids could contribute to enhanced ribozyme catalysis, providing a driving force for the evolution of sequence and amino acid–specific aminoacyl-RNA synthetase ribozymes in the RNA World. The synthesis of specifically aminoacylated RNAs, an unlikely prospect for nonenzymatic reactions but a likely one for ribozymes, could have set the stage for the subsequent evolution of coded protein synthesis.",

Report here that the level of a circulating protein, leucine-rich alpha-2 glycoprotein 1 (LRG1), is elevated in the atherosclerotic tissue and serum samples from patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). LRG1 stimulated macrophages to proinflammatory M1-like polarization through the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways. The LRG1 knockout mice showed significantly delayed atherogenesis progression and reduced levels of macrophage-related proinflammatory cytokines in a high-fat diet–induced Apoe −/− mouse atherosclerosis model. An anti-LRG1 neutralizing antibody also effectively blocked LRG1-induced macrophage M1-like polarization in vitro and conferred therapeutic benefits to animals with ApoE deficiency-induced atherosclerosis. LRG1 may therefore serve as an additional biomarker for CAD and targeting LRG1 could offer a potential therapeutic strategy for CAD patients by mitigating the proinflammatory response of macrophages.",

Polymorphonuclear (PMN)-MDSCs, which are phenotypically and morphologically defined as a subset of neutrophils, cause major immune suppression in the TME, posing a significant challenge in the development of effective immunotherapies. Despite recent advances in our understanding of PMN-MDSC functions, the mechanism that gives rise to immunosuppressive neutrophils within the TME remains elusive. Both in vivo and in vitro, newly recruited neutrophils into the tumor sites remained activated and highly motile for several days and developed immunosuppressive phenotypes, as indicated by increased arginase 1 (Arg1) and dcTrail-R1 expression and suppressed anticancer CD8 T cell cytotoxicity. The strong suppressive function was successfully recapitulated by incubating naive neutrophils with cancer cell culture supernatant in vitro. Cancer metabolite secretome analyses of the culture supernatant revealed that both murine and human cancers released lipid mediators to induce the differentiation of immunosuppressive neutrophils. Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) lipidomic analysis identified platelet-activation factor (PAF; 1- O -alkyl-2-acetyl- sn -glycero-3-phosphocholine) as a common tumor-derived lipid mediator that induces neutrophil differentiation. Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 2 (LPCAT2), the PAF biosynthetic enzyme, is up-regulated in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and shows an unfavorable correlation with patient survival across multiple cancer types.

          "abstract": "Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc/Arg3.1) is an immediate early gene that plays a vital role in learning and memory. Arc protein has structural and functional properties similar to viral Group-specific antigen (Gag) protein and mediates the intercellular RNA transfer through virus-like capsids. However, the regulators and secretion pathway through which Arc capsids maneuver cargos are unclear. Here, we identified that phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) mediates Arc capsid assembly and secretion through the endosomal–multivesicular body (MVB) pathway. Indeed, reconstituted Arc protein preferably binds to PI3P. In HEK293T cells, Arc forms puncta that colocalize with FYVE, an endosomal PI3P marker, as well as Rab5 and CD63, early endosomal and MVB markers, respectively. Superresolution imaging resolves Arc accumulates within the intraluminal vesicles of MVB. CRISPR double knockout of RalA and RalB, crucial GTPases for MVB biogenesis and exocytosis, severely reduces the Arc-mediated RNA transfer efficiency. RalA/B double knockdown in cultured rat cortical neurons increases the percentage of mature dendritic spines. Intake of extracellular vesicles purified from Arc-expressing wild-type, but not RalA/B double knockdown, cells in mouse cortical neurons reduces their surface GlutA1 levels. These results suggest that unlike the HIV Gag, whose membrane targeting requires interaction with plasma-membrane-specific phosphatidyl inositol (4,5) bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), the assembly of Arc capsids is mediated by PI3P at endocytic membranes. Understanding Arc’s secretion pathway helps gain insights into its role in intercellular cargo transfer and highlights the commonality and distinction of trafficking mechanisms between structurally resembled capsid proteins.",

          "abstract": "As climate change shifts crop exposure to dry and wet extremes, a better understanding of factors governing crop response is needed. Recent studies identified shallow groundwater—groundwater within or near the crop rooting zone—as influential, yet existing evidence is largely based on theoretical crop model simulations, indirect or static groundwater data, or small-scale field studies. Here, we use observational satellite yield data and dynamic water table simulations from 1999 to 2018 to provide field-scale evidence for shallow groundwater effects on maize yields across the United States Corn Belt. We identify three lines of evidence supporting groundwater influence: 1) crop model simulations better match observed yields after improvements in groundwater representation; 2) machine learning analysis of observed yields and modeled groundwater levels reveals a subsidy zone between 1.1 and 2.5 m depths, with yield penalties at shallower depths and no effect at deeper depths; and 3) locations with groundwater typically in the subsidy zone display higher yield stability across time. We estimate an average 3.4% yield increase when groundwater levels are at optimum depth, and this effect roughly doubles in dry conditions. Groundwater yield subsidies occur ~35% of years on average across locations, with 75% of the region benefitting in at least 10% of years. Overall, we estimate that groundwater-yield interactions had a net monetary contribution of approximately $10 billion from 1999 to 2018. This study provides empirical evidence for region-wide groundwater yield impacts and further underlines the need for better quantification of groundwater levels and their dynamic responses to short- and long-term weather conditions.",

Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a portable optical neuroimaging method that can be used to measure neural activity with good temporal and spatial resolution. However, the reliability of fNIRS for detecting the neural correlates of consciousness remains to be established. In a series of studies, we evaluated whether fNIRS can record sensory, perceptual, and command-driven neural processing in healthy participants and in behaviorally nonresponsive patients. At the individual healthy subject level, we demonstrate that fNIRS can detect commonly studied resting state networks, sensorimotor processing, speech-specific auditory processing, and volitional command-driven brain activity to a motor imagery task. We then tested fNIRS with three acutely brain injured patients and found that one could willfully modulate their brain activity when instructed to imagine playing a game of tennis—providing evidence of preserved consciousness despite no observable behavioral signs of awareness. The successful application of fNIRS for detecting preserved awareness among behaviorally nonresponsive patients highlights its potential as a valuable tool for uncovering hidden cognitive states in critical care settings.",

          "abstract": "Facing complex and variable emerging antibiotic pollutants, the traditional development of functional materials is a “trial-and-error” process based on physicochemical principles, where laborious steps and long timescales make it difficult to accelerate technical breakthroughs. Notably, natural biomolecular coronas derived from highly tolerant organisms under significant contamination scenarios can be used in conjunction with nanotechnology to tackling emerging contaminants of concern. Here, super worms ( Tubifex tubifex ) with high pollutant tolerance were integrated with nano-zero valent iron (nZVI) to effectively reduce the content of 17 antibiotics in wastewater within 7 d. Inspired by the synergistic remediation, nZVI-augmented worms were constructed as biological nanocomposites. Neither nZVI (0.3 to 3 g/L) nor worms (10 4 to 10 5 per liter) alone efficiently degraded florfenicol (FF, as a representative antibiotic), while their composite removed 87% of FF (3 μmol/L). Under antibiotic exposure, biomolecules secreted by worms formed a corona on and modified the nZVI particle surface, enabling the nano–bio interface greater functionality, including responsiveness, enrichment, and reduction. Mechanistically, FF exposure activated glucose–alanine cycle pathways that synthesize organic acids and amines as major metabolites, which were assembled into vesicles and secreted, thereby interacting with nZVI in a biologically response design strategy. Lactic acid and urea formed hydrogen bonds with FF, enriched analyte presence at the heterogeneous interface. Succinic and lactic acids corroded the nZVI passivation layer and promoted electron transfer through surface conjugation. This unique strategy highlights biomolecular coronas as a complex resource to augment nano-enabled technologies and will provide shortcuts for rational manipulation of nanomaterial surfaces with coordinated multifunctionalities.",

Here, we present the free-electron laser (FEL) structures of a matched ATP-bound Pol II and the hyperactive Rpb1 T834P bridge helix (BH) mutant at the highest resolution to date. The radiation-damage-free FEL structures reveal the full active site interaction network, including the trigger loop (TL) in the closed conformation, bonafide occupancy of both site A and B Mg 2+ , and, more importantly, a putative third (site C) Mg 2+ analogous to that described for some DNA polymerases but not observed previously for cellular RNA polymerases. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the structures indicate that the third Mg 2+ is coordinated and stabilized at its observed position. TL residues provide half of the substrate binding pocket while multiple TL/BH interactions induce conformational changes that could allow translocation upon substrate hydrolysis. Consistent with TL/BH communication, a FEL structure and MD simulations of the T834P mutant reveal rearrangement of some active site interactions supporting potential plasticity in active site function and long-distance effects on both the width of the central channel and TL conformation, likely underlying its increased elongation rate at the expense of fidelity.",

In nonhuman primates, two cone opponent pathways are well established: an L vs. M cone circuit linked to the midget ganglion cell type, often called the red-green pathway, and an S vs. L + M cone circuit linked to the small bistratified ganglion cell type, often called the blue-yellow pathway. These pathways have been taken to correspond in human vision to cardinal directions in a trichromatic color space, providing the parallel inputs to higher-level color processing. Yet linking cone opponency in the nonhuman primate retina to color mechanisms in human vision has proven particularly difficult. Here, we apply connectomic reconstruction to the human foveal retina to trace parallel excitatory synaptic outputs from the S-ON (or “blue-cone”) bipolar cell to the small bistratified cell and two additional ganglion cell types: a large bistratified ganglion cell and a subpopulation of ON-midget ganglion cells, whose synaptic connections suggest a significant and unique role in color vision. These two ganglion cell types are postsynaptic to both S-ON and L vs. M opponent midget bipolar cells and thus define excitatory pathways in the foveal retina that merge the cardinal red-green and blue-yellow circuits, with the potential for trichromatic cone opponency at the first stage of human vision.",

          "abstract": "Synchronization of coupled oscillators is a universal phenomenon encountered across different scales and contexts, e.g., chemical wave patterns, superconductors, and the unison applause we witness in concert halls. The existence of common underlying coupling rules defines universality classes, revealing a fundamental sameness between seemingly distinct systems. Identifying rules of synchronization in any particular setting is hence of paramount relevance. Here, we address the coupling rules within an embryonic oscillator ensemble linked to vertebrate embryo body axis segmentation. In vertebrates, the periodic segmentation of the body axis involves synchronized signaling oscillations in cells within the presomitic mesoderm (PSM), from which somites, the prevertebrae, form. At the molecular level, it is known that intact Notch-signaling and cell-to-cell contact are required for synchronization between PSM cells. However, an understanding of the coupling rules is still lacking. To identify these, we develop an experimental assay that enables direct quantification of synchronization dynamics within mixtures of oscillating cell ensembles, for which the initial input frequency and phase distribution are known. Our results reveal a “winner-takes-it-all” synchronization outcome, i.e., the emerging collective rhythm matches one of the input rhythms. Using a combination of theory and experimental validation, we develop a coupling model, the “Rectified Kuramoto” (ReKu) model, characterized by a phase-dependent, nonreciprocal interaction in the coupling of oscillatory cells. Such nonreciprocal synchronization rules reveal fundamental similarities between embryonic oscillators and a class of collective behaviors seen in neurons and fireflies, where higher-level computations are performed and linked to nonreciprocal synchronization.",

          "abstract": "Synonymous codons were originally viewed as interchangeable, with no phenotypic consequences. However, substantial evidence has now demonstrated that synonymous substitutions can perturb a variety of gene expression and protein homeostasis mechanisms, including translational efficiency, translational fidelity, and cotranslational folding of the encoded protein. To date, most studies of synonymous codon-derived perturbations have focused on effects within a single gene. Here, we show that synonymous codon substitutions made far within the coding sequence of Escherichia coli plasmid-encoded chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( cat ) can significantly increase expression of the divergent upstream tetracycline resistance gene, tetR . In four out of nine synonymously recoded cat sequences tested, expression of the upstream tetR gene was significantly elevated due to transcription of a long antisense RNA (asRNA) originating from a transcription start site within cat . Surprisingly, transcription of this asRNA readily bypassed the native tet transcriptional repression mechanism. Even more surprisingly, accumulation of the TetR protein correlated with the level of asRNA, rather than total tetR RNA. These effects of synonymous codon substitutions on transcription and translation of a neighboring gene suggest that synonymous codon usage in bacteria may be under selection to both preserve the amino acid sequence of the encoded gene and avoid DNA sequence elements that can significantly perturb expression of neighboring genes. Avoiding such sequences may be especially important in plasmids and prokaryotic genomes, where genes and regulatory elements are often densely packed. Similar considerations may apply to the design of genetic circuits for synthetic biology applications.",

We found that either VPA or Poly Inosine:Cytosine (which mimics a viral infection), administered at mouse embryonic day 12.5, induced a neurotransmitter switch from GABA to glutamate in PV- and CCK-expressing interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex by postnatal day 10. The switch was present for only a brief period during early postnatal development, observed in male and female mice at postnatal day 21 and reversed in both males and females by postnatal day 30. At postnatal day 90, male mice exhibited stereotyped repetitive behaviors and diminished social interaction while female mice exhibited only stereotyped repetitive behavior. Transfecting GAD1 in PV- and CCK-expressing interneurons at postnatal day 10, to reintroduce GABA expression, overrode the switch and prevented expression of autistic-like behavior. These findings point to an important role of neurotransmitter switching in mediating the environmental causes of autism.",

          "abstract": "Hatching failure affects up to 77% of eggs laid by threatened bird species, yet the true prevalence and drivers of egg fertilization failure versus embryo mortality as underlying mechanisms of hatching failure are unknown. Here, using ten years of data comprising 4,371 eggs laid by a population of a threatened bird, the hihi ( Notiomystis cincta) , we investigate the relative importance of infertility and embryo death as drivers of hatching failure and explore population-level factors associated with them. We show that of the 1,438 eggs that failed to hatch (33% of laid eggs) between 2010 and 2020, 83% failed due to embryo mortality, with the majority failing in the early stages of embryonic development. In the most comprehensive estimates of infertility rates in a wild bird population to date, we find that fertilization failure accounts for around 17% of hatching failure overall and is more prevalent in years where the population is smaller and more male biased. Male embryos are more likely to die during early development than females, but we find no overall effect of sex on the successful development of embryos. Offspring fathered by within-pair males have significantly higher inbreeding levels than extra-pair offspring; however, we find no effect of inbreeding nor extra-pair paternity on embryo mortality. Accurately distinguishing between infertility and embryo mortality in this study provides unique insight into the underlying causes of reproductive failure over a long-term scale and reveals the complex risks of small population sizes to the reproduction of threatened species.",

          "abstract": "The late Paleocene and early Eocene (LPEE) are characterized by long-term (million years, Myr) global warming and by transient, abrupt (kiloyears, kyr) warming events, termed hyperthermals. Although both have been attributed to greenhouse (CO 2 ) forcing, the longer-term trend in climate was likely influenced by additional forcing factors (i.e., tectonics) and the extent to which warming was driven by atmospheric CO 2 remains unclear. Here, we use a suite of new and existing observations from planktic foraminifera collected at Pacific Ocean Drilling Program Sites 1209 and 1210 and inversion of a multiproxy Bayesian hierarchical model to quantify sea surface temperature (SST) and atmospheric CO 2 over a 6-Myr interval. Our reconstructions span the initiation of long-term LPEE warming (~58 Ma), and the two largest Paleogene hyperthermals, the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, ~56 Ma) and Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 (ETM-2, ~54 Ma). Our results show strong coupling between CO 2 and temperature over the long- (LPEE) and short-term (PETM and ETM-2) but differing Pacific climate sensitivities over the two timescales. Combined CO 2 and carbon isotope trends imply the carbon source driving CO 2 increase was likely methanogenic, organic, or mixed for the PETM and organic for ETM-2, whereas a source with higher δ 13 C values (e.g., volcanic degassing) is associated with the long-term LPEE. Reconstructed emissions for the PETM (5,800 Gt C) and ETM-2 (3,800 Gt C) are comparable in mass to future emission scenarios, reinforcing the value of these events as analogs of anthropogenic change.",

These symptoms were alleviated by gut bacterial inoculation. Gut metabolite profiling revealed that succinate, produced by Lactobacillus Firm-5, played deterministic roles in activating ilp gene expression and in regulating metabolism in honeybees.

          "abstract": "Medium chain fatty acids are commonly consumed as part of diets for endurance sports and as medical treatment in ketogenic diets where these diets regulate energy metabolism and increase adenosine levels. However, the role of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1), which is responsible for adenosine transport across membranes in this process, is not well understood. Here, we investigate ENT1 activity in controlling the effects of two dietary medium chain fatty acids (decanoic and octanoic acid), employing the tractable model system Dictyostelium. We show that genetic ablation of three ENT1 orthologues unexpectedly improves cell proliferation specifically following decanoic acid treatment. This effect is not caused by increased adenosine levels triggered by both fatty acids in the presence of ENT1 activity. Instead, we show that decanoic acid increases expression of energy-related genes relevant for fatty acid β-oxidation, and that pharmacological inhibition of ENT1 activity leads to an enhanced effect of decanoic acid to increase expression of tricarboxylicacid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation components. Importantly, similar transcriptional changes have been shown in the rat hippocampus during ketogenic diet treatment. We validated these changes by showing enhanced mitochondria load and reduced lipid droplets. Thus, our data show that ENT1 regulates the medium chain fatty acid-induced increase in cellular adenosine levels and the decanoic acid-induced expression of important metabolic enzymes in energy provision, identifying a key role for ENT1 proteins in metabolic effects of medium chain fatty acids.",

By means of single-cell transcriptomics and manipulation of morphine-responsive neurons, we have identified an ensemble of neurons in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) that regulates mechanical nociception in mice. Among these, forced activation or silencing of excitatory RVM BDNF projection neurons mimicked or completely reversed morphine-induced mechanical antinociception, respectively, via a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB)–dependent mechanism and activation of inhibitory spinal galanin-positive neurons.

Mechanistically, proximity of micronuclei to mitochondria led to oxidation-driven homo-oligomerization of p62, limiting endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)–dependent micronuclear envelope repair by triggering autophagic degradation. We also found that p62 levels correlate with increased chromothripsis across human cancer cell lines and with increased CIN in colorectal tumors.

Alfvén waves are perturbations of the interplanetary magnetic field that transport energy. We use in situ measurements from the Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter spacecraft to investigate a stream of solar wind as it traverses the inner heliosphere. The observations show heating and acceleration of the plasma between the outer edge of the corona and near the orbit of Venus, along with the presence of large-amplitude Alfvén waves. We calculate that the damping and mechanical work performed by the Alfvén waves are sufficient to power the heating and acceleration of the fast solar wind in the inner heliosphere.",

          "abstract": "Chromosome-containing micronuclei are a hallmark of aggressive cancers. Micronuclei frequently undergo irreversible collapse, exposing their enclosed chromatin to the cytosol. Micronuclear rupture catalyzes chromosomal rearrangements, epigenetic abnormalities, and inflammation, yet mechanisms safeguarding micronuclear integrity are poorly understood. In this study, we found that mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) disrupt micronuclei by promoting a noncanonical function of charged multivesicular body protein 7 (CHMP7), a scaffolding protein for the membrane repair complex known as endosomal sorting complex required for transport III (ESCRT-III). ROS retained CHMP7 in micronuclei while disrupting its interaction with other ESCRT-III components. ROS-induced cysteine oxidation stimulated CHMP7 oligomerization and binding to the nuclear membrane protein LEMD2, disrupting micronuclear envelopes. Furthermore, this ROS-CHMP7 pathological axis engendered chromosome shattering known to result from micronuclear rupture. It also mediated micronuclear disintegrity under hypoxic conditions, linking tumor hypoxia with downstream processes driving cancer progression.",

          "abstract": "Selective degradation of pathological protein aggregates while sparing monomeric forms is of major therapeutic interest. The E3 ligase tripartite motif–containing protein 21 (TRIM21) degrades antibody-bound proteins in an assembly state–specific manner due to the requirement of TRIM21 RING domain clustering for activation, yet effective targeting of intracellular assemblies remains challenging. Here, we fused the RING domain of TRIM21 to a target-specific nanobody to create intracellularly expressed constructs capable of selectively degrading assembled proteins. We evaluated this approach against green fluorescent protein–tagged histone 2B (H2B-GFP) and tau, a protein that undergoes pathological aggregation in Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases. RING-nanobody degraders prevented or reversed tau aggregation in culture and in vivo, with minimal impact on monomeric tau. This approach may have therapeutic potential for the many disorders driven by intracellular protein aggregation.",

The salt giant in the Mediterranean Sea formed as a result of the restriction of its gateway to the Atlantic during the Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC) 5.97 to 5.33 million years ago. Here, we quantify the biodiversity changes associated with the MSC based on a compilation of the Mediterranean fossil record. We conclude that 86 endemic species of the 2006 pre-MSC marine species survived the crisis, and that the present eastward-decreasing richness gradient in the Mediterranean was established after the MSC.",

          "abstract": "Humans, dolphins, and elephants are the only known species that vocally label their conspecifics. It remains unclear whether nonhuman primates share this ability. We recorded spontaneous “phee-call” dialogues between pairs of marmoset monkeys. We discovered that marmosets use these calls to vocally label their conspecifics. Moreover, they respond more consistently and correctly to calls that are specifically directed at them. Analysis of calls from multiple monkeys revealed that family members use similar calls and acoustic features to label others and perform vocal learning. These findings shed light on the complexities of social vocalizations among nonhuman primates and suggest that marmoset vocalizations may provide a model for understanding aspects of human language, thereby offering new insights into the evolution of social communication.",

Using space geodetic and seismic observations, we have shown that the event deformed the peninsula with a peak uplift reaching 5 meters at the west coast. Shallow slip exceeded 10 meters on an offshore fault. Peak stress drop was greater than 10 megapascals. This devastating event began with a slow rupture propagation lasting 15 to 20 seconds near its hypocenter, where seismic swarms had surged since 2020 because of lower-crust fluid supply. The slow start was accompanied by intense high-frequency seismic radiation. These observations suggest a distinct coseismic slip mode reflecting high heterogeneity in fault properties within a fluid-rich fault zone.",

Our cryo–electron microscopy studies show that, within the NuA4/TIP60 complex, the E1A binding protein P400 (EP400) subunit serves as a scaffold holding the different functional modules in specific positions, creating a distinct arrangement of the actin-related protein (ARP) module. EP400 interacts with the transformation/transcription domain-associated protein (TRRAP) subunit by using a footprint that overlaps with that of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex, preventing the formation of a hybrid complex. Loss of the TRRAP subunit leads to mislocalization of NuA4/TIP60, resulting in the redistribution of H2A.Z and its acetylation across the genome, emphasizing the dual functionality of NuA4/TIP60 as a single macromolecular assembly.",

          "abstract": "Microglia, the crucial immune cells inhabiting the central nervous system (CNS), perform a range of vital functions, encompassing immune defense and neuronal regulation. Microglia subsets with diverse functions and distinct developmental regulations have been identified recently. It is generally accepted that all microglia originate from hematopoiesis and depend on the myeloid transcription factor PU.1. However, a recent study reported the existence of mrc1 + microglia in zebrafish embryos, which are seemingly independent of Pu.1 and reliant on lymphatic vessels, sparking great interest in the possibility of lymphatic-originated microglia. To address this, we took advantage of a pu.1 knock-in zebrafish allele for a detailed investigation. Our results conclusively showed that almost all zebrafish embryonic microglia (~95% on average) express pu.1 . Further, lineage tracing and mutant analysis revealed that these microglia neither emerged from nor depended on lymphatic vessels. In essence, our study refutes the presence of pu.1 -independent but lymphatic-dependent microglia.",

Our understanding of this period is hindered by limited written sources and few archaeogenetic studies. We analyzed 33 individuals from Las Gobas, a necropolis in northern Spain, spanning the 7th to 11th centuries. By combining archaeological and osteological data with kinship, metagenomics, and ancestry analyses, we investigate conflicts, health, and demography of these individuals. We reveal intricate family relationships and genetic continuity within a consanguineous population while also identifying several zoonoses indicative of close interactions with animals. Notably, one individual was infected with a variola virus phylogenetically clustering with the northern European variola complex between ~885 and 1000 CE.

However, existing tools are either invasive or too large for sampling liquids in tortuous and narrow spaces. Here we report a fundamental liquid sampling mechanism that enables millimeter-scale soft capsules for sampling liquids in confined spaces. The miniature capsule is enabled by flexible magnetic valves and superabsorbent polymer, fully wirelessly controlled for on-demand fluid sampling. A group of miniature capsules could navigate in fluid-filled and confined spaces safely using a rolling locomotion. The integration of on-demand triggering, sampling, and sealing mechanism and the agile group locomotion allows us to demonstrate precise control of the soft capsules, navigating and sampling body fluids in a phantom and animal organ ex vivo, guided by ultrasound and x-ray medical imaging. The proposed mechanism and wirelessly controlled devices spur the next-generation technologies for minimally invasive disease diagnosis.",

Among the series of tunable devices, electrically controllable devices have garnered particular attention owing to their seamless integration with existing electronic equipment. This review presents recent progress reported with respect to electrically tunable devices, providing an overview of their technological development trajectory and current state of the art. In particular, we analyze the major tuning strategies and discuss the applications in spatial light modulators, tunable optical waveguides, and adaptable emissivity regulators. Furthermore, the challenges and opportunities associated with their implementation are explored, thereby highlighting their potential to bridge the gap between electronics and photonics to enable the development of groundbreaking optical systems.",

          "abstract": "RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV) forms a complex with RNA-directed RNA polymerase 2 (RDR2) to produce double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) precursors essential for plant gene silencing. In the “backtracking-triggered RNA channeling” model, Pol IV backtracks and delivers its transcript’s 3′ terminus to RDR2, which synthesizes dsRNA. However, the mechanisms underlying Pol IV backtracking and RNA protection from cleavage are unclear. Here, we determined cryo–electron microscopy structures of Pol IV elongation complexes at four states of its nucleotide addition cycle (NAC): posttranslocation, guanosine triphosphate–bound, pretranslocation, and backtracked states. The structures reveal that Pol IV maintains an open DNA cleft and kinked bridge helix in all NAC states, loosely interacts with the nucleoside triphosphate substrate, and barely contacts proximal backtracked nucleotides. Biochemical data indicate that Pol IV is inefficient in forward translocation and RNA cleavage. These findings suggest that Pol IV transcription elongation is prone to backtracking and incapable of RNA hydrolysis, ensuring efficient dsRNA production by Pol IV–RDR2.",

We here identify the unique zinc-finger domain of CDCA7 as an evolutionarily conserved hemimethylation-sensing zinc finger (HMZF) domain. Cryo–electron microscopy structural analysis of the CDCA7-nucleosome complex reveals that the HMZF domain can recognize hemimethylated CpG in the outward-facing DNA major groove within the nucleosome core particle, whereas UHRF1, the critical activator of the maintenance methyltransferase DNMT1, cannot. CDCA7 recruits HELLS to hemimethylated chromatin and facilitates UHRF1-mediated H3 ubiquitylation associated with replication-uncoupled maintenance DNA methylation. We propose that the CDCA7-HELLS nucleosome remodeling complex assists the maintenance of DNA methylation on chromatin by sensing hemimethylated CpG that is otherwise inaccessible to UHRF1 and DNMT1.",

Using immunopeptidomics, we have identified a peptide derived from XPO1 that can be recognized by the activating NK cell receptor KIR2DS2 in the context of human leukocyte antigen–C. The peptide can be endogenously processed and presented to activate NK cells specifically through this receptor. Although high XPO1 expression in cancer is commonly associated with a poor prognosis, we show that the outcome of specific cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, can be substantially improved if there is concomitant evidence of NK cell infiltration.

Here, we show that the CDCA7 CRD adopts a unique zinc-binding structure that recognizes a CpG dyad in a non-B DNA formed by two sequence motifs. CDCA7, but not ICF mutants, preferentially binds the non-B DNA with strand-specific CpG hemi-methylation. The unmethylated sequence motif is highly enriched at centromeres of human chromosomes, whereas the methylated motif is distributed throughout the genome. At S phase, CDCA7, but not ICF mutants, is concentrated in constitutive heterochromatin foci, and the formation of such foci can be inhibited by exogenous hemi-methylated non-B DNA bound by the CRD.

Heterologous expression in yeast and Nicotiana benthamiana indeed demonstrated the role of these enzymes in the biosynthesis of 4-oxo-MeCLA, which, expectedly, is derived from carlactone as substrate.

To explore this phenomenon, we set up mouse lymphoma models activating or not activating NK cells. Both tumor types elicited type I interferon production, leading to the expression of a T cell exhaustion-like signature in NK cells, which included immune checkpoint proteins (ICPs). However, NK cell dysfunction occurred exclusively in the tumor model that triggered NK cell activation. Moreover, ICP-positive NK cells demonstrated heightened reactivity compared to negative ones. Furthermore, the onset of NK cell dysfunction was swift and temporally dissociated from ICPs induction, which occurred as a later event during tumor growth. Last, NK cell responsiveness was restored when stimulation was discontinued, and interleukin-15 had a positive impact on this reversion. Therefore, our data demonstrate that the reactivity of NK cells is dynamically controlled and that NK cell dysfunction is a reversible process uncoupled from the expression of ICPs.",

The wavelength of these resonances is, however, often too short to be resolved even by methods capable of atomic resolution, i.e., scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We combine a CO molecule with a superconducting cluster pre-attached to an STM tip to maximize both spatial and energy resolution, thus demonstrating the superior properties of such double-functionalized probes by imaging the spatial distribution of YSR states.

Histamine application ex vivo altered the activity of various retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), including direction-selective RGCs that gained responses to high motion velocities. These results were reproduced in vivo with optic tract recordings where histaminergic retinopetal axons were activated chemogenetically. Such changes could improve vision of fast-moving objects (e.g., while running), which fits with the known increased activity of histaminergic neurons during arousal. An antihistamine drug reduced optomotor responses to high-speed moving stimuli in freely moving mice. In humans, the same antihistamine nonuniformly modulated visual sensitivity across the visual field, indicating an evolutionary conserved function of the histaminergic system.

We identify regions within the DNMT3A1 amino terminus that bind H2AK119Ub and the nucleosome acidic patch. This bidentate interaction is required for effective DNMT3A1 engagement with H2AK119Ub-modified chromatin in cells. Further, aberrant redistribution of DNMT3A1 to Polycomb target genes recapitulates the cancer-associated DNA hypermethylation signature and inhibits their transcriptional activation during cell differentiation. This effect is rescued by disruption of the DNMT3A1–acidic patch interaction.

We illustrate that the conserved splicing factor U2 snRNP auxiliary factor large subunit B (U2AF65B) modulates splicing of mRNA surveillance complex, contributing to transcriptomic homeostasis in maize. The functionality of the mRNA surveillance pathway requires ZmU2AF65B-mediated normal splicing of upstream frameshift 3 ( ZmUPF3 ) pre-mRNA, encoding a core factor in this pathway. Intriguingly, sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV)–coded nuclear inclusion protein a protease (NIa-Pro) hinders the splicing function of ZmU2AF65B. Furthermore, NIa-Pro disrupts ZmU2AF65B binding to ZmUPF3 pre-mRNA, leading to dysregulated splicing of ZmUPF3 transcripts and, consequently, impairing mRNA surveillance, thus facilitating viral infection.

To understand this process, we freeze model, brittle hydrogel samples, while observing the growth of ice-filled cracks that break these apart. We show that damage is not caused by the expansion of water upon freezing or the growth of ice-filled cavities in the hydrogel that exert pressure on the surrounding material. Instead, local ice growth dehydrates the adjacent hydrogel, leading to drying-induced fracture. This dehydration is driven by the process of cryosuction, whereby undercooled ice sucks nearby water toward itself, feeding ice growth. Our results highlight the strong analogy between freezing damage and desiccation cracking, which we anticipate being useful for developing an understanding of both topics. Our results should also give useful insights into a wide range of freezing processes, including cryopreservation, food science, and frost heave.",

          "abstract": "A localized Zeeman field, intensified at heterostructure interfaces, could play a crucial role in a broad area including spintronics and unconventional superconductors. Conventionally, the generation of a local Zeeman field is achieved through magnetic exchange coupling with a magnetic material. However, magnetic elements often introduce defects, which could weaken or destroy superconductivity. Alternatively, the coupling between a superconductor with strong spin-orbit coupling and a nonmagnetic chiral material could serve as a promising approach to generate a spin-active interface. Here, we leverage an interface superconductor, namely, induced superconductivity in noble metal surface states, to probe the spin-active interface. Our results unveil an enhanced interface Zeeman field, which selectively closes the surface superconducting gap while preserving the bulk superconducting pairing. The chiral material, i.e., trigonal tellurium, also induces Andreev bound states (ABS) exhibiting spin polarization. The field dependence of ABS manifests a substantially enhanced interface Landé g -factor ( g eff ~ 12), thereby corroborating the enhanced interface Zeeman energy.",

This property has well-established implications in statistical physics but remains underexplored in biological networks, especially for bacteria and other prokaryotes whose regulation of gene expression occurs predominantly at the transcriptional level. Focusing on the reconstructed regulatory network of Escherichia coli , we examine network responses to transient single-gene perturbations. We predict irreversibility in numerous cases and find that the incidence of irreversibility increases with the proximity of the perturbed gene to positive circuits in the network. Comparison with experimental data suggests a connection between the predicted irreversibility to transient perturbations and the evolutionary response to permanent perturbations.",

Essential genes are transcribed above a lower limit of one message per cell cycle. Gene expression is achieved by load balancing between transcription and translation.

Here, we isolated a narrow-leaf gene, TaWAK2-A , through a map-based cloning strategy. TaWAK2-A encodes a wall-associated kinase (WAK), for which a single Ala-to-Val amino acid substitution reduces the protein stability, leading to a narrow-leaf phenotype in wheat. Further investigation suggests that TaWAK2 directly interacts with and phosphorylates TaNAL1, a trypsin-like serine/cysteine protease. The phosphorylated TaNAL1 is then involved in the degradation of the zinc finger transcription factor TaDST, which acts as a repressor of leaf expansion by activating the expression of the cytokinin oxidase gene TaCKX9 and triggering in vivo cytokinin degradation. Therefore, our findings elucidate a signaling cascade involving TaWAK2-TaNAL1-TaDST that sheds light on the regulation of wheat leaf development.",

Using fluorescent voltage imaging throughout dendritic arborizations in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, we demonstrate a unique chloride ion (Cl − )–dependent remote computation mechanism in the distal branches. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials triggered by local laser photolysis of caged glutamate spread along dendrites, with gradual amplification toward the distal end while attenuation toward the soma. Tour de force subcellular patch-clamp recordings from thin branches complemented by biophysical model simulations revealed that the asymmetric augmentation of excitation relies on tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium ion (Na + ) channels and Cl − conductance accompanied by a more hyperpolarized dendritic resting potential. Together, this study reveals the cooperative voltage-dependent actions of cation and anion conductance for dendritic supralinear computation, which can locally decode the spatiotemporal context of synaptic inputs.",

For this purpose, we used the model organism Physcomitrium patens , which features a singular pluripotent stem cell known as the gametophore apical cell. We show that the activity of cytokinins, critical stem cell regulators, is restricted to the gametophore apical cell due to the specific localization of PpLOG, the enzyme responsible for cytokinin activation. In turn, PpTAW, which promotes differentiating cell identity of the merophyte, is excluded from the gametophore apical cell by the action of cytokinins.

Unraveling the complex mechanisms governing chilling tolerance in rice is crucial for molecular breeding of cold-tolerant varieties.

OsERF52 directly regulates the expression of C-Repeat Binding Factor ( CBF ) genes in rice. In addition, Osmotic Stress/ABA-Activated Protein Kinase 9–mediated phosphorylation of OsERF52 at S261 enhances its stability and interaction with Ideal Plant Architecture 1 and OsbHLH002/OsICE1. This collaborative activation leads to the expression of OsCBFs , thereby initiating the chilling response in rice.

We find that loss of all three TETs during NSC specification is dispensable for neural induction and neuronal differentiation but critical for astrocyte and oligodendrocyte formation, demonstrating a selective loss of glial competence. Mechanistically, TET-mediated demethylation was essential for commissioning neural-specific enhancers in proximity to master neurodevelopmental and glial transcription factor genes and for induction of these genes. Consistently, loss of all three TETs in embryonic NSCs in mice compromised glial gene expression and corticogenesis. Thus, TET-dependent developmental demethylation is an essential regulatory mechanism for neural enhancer commissioning during NSC specification and is a cell-intrinsic determinant of NSC identity and gliogenic potential.",

Here, we report the highest-resolution simulation of magnetorotational turbulence ever conducted. Our simulations reveal a constant cross-scale energy flux, a hallmark of the inertial range. We found that as the cascade proceeds to smaller scales in the inertial range, the kinetic and magnetic energies tend toward equipartitioning with the same spectral slope, and slow magnetosonic fluctuations dominate over Alfvénic fluctuations, having twice the energy.

The expression level of OsDes1 is positively associated with stay-green in natural variations of japonica rice, suggesting that OsDes1 would be alternatively used in breeding programs. Mechanistically, OsDes1 targets the promoter of the Rieske FeS protein gene OsPetC to activate its expression and interacts with OsPetC to protect against its degradation, thus promoting stay-green and ultimately improving the grain yield. OsDes1 also binds to the promoter region of defense-related genes, such as OsPR1b , and activates their expression, leading to enhanced disease resistance.

In both models, the progression of fibrosis was associated with reduced levels of host lung progenitors, enabling engraftment of donor progenitors without any additional conditioning, in contrast to our previous studies. Two months after transplantation, engrafted progenitors expanded to form numerous donor-derived patches comprising AT1 and AT2 alveolar cells, as well as donor-derived mesenchymal and endothelial cells.

          "abstract": "Introducing specific strains of probiotics into the gut microbiome is a promising way to modulate the intestinal microbiome to treat various health conditions clinically. However, oral probiotics typically have a temporary or limited impact on the gut microbiome and overall health benefits. Here, we reported a 3D printed cellulose-derived spiral tube-like scaffold that enabled high efficacy of the oral delivery of probiotics. Benefiting from the unique surface pattern, this system can effectively extend the retention time of loaded probiotics in the gut without invading nearby tissues, provide a favorable environment for the survival and long-term colonization of loaded probiotics, and influence the intestinal ecosystem as a dietary fiber after degradation. We demonstrate Roseburia intestinalis -loaded scaffold exerts noticeable impacts on the regulation of the gut microbiome to treat various gut-related diseases, including obesity and inflammatory bowel disease; thus, we provide a universal platform for oral delivery of probiotics.",

          "abstract": "Aging is associated with progressive gray matter loss in the brain. This spatially specific, morphological change over the life span in humans is also found in chimpanzees, and the comparison between these great ape species provides a unique evolutionary perspective on human brain aging. Here, we present a data-driven, comparative framework to explore the relationship between gray matter atrophy with age and recent cerebral expansion in the phylogeny of chimpanzees and humans. In humans, we show a positive relationship between cerebral aging and cortical expansion, whereas no such relationship was found in chimpanzees. This human-specific association between strong aging effects and large relative cortical expansion is particularly present in higher-order cognitive regions of the ventral prefrontal cortex and supports the “last-in-first-out” hypothesis for brain maturation in recent evolutionary development of human faculties.",

          "abstract": "Photonic topological insulators (PTIs) have been proposed as an analogy to topological insulators in electronic systems. In particular, two-dimensional PTIs have gained attention for the integrated circuit applications. However, controlling the topological phase after fabrication is difficult because the photonic topology requires the built-in specific structures. This study experimentally demonstrates the band inversion in two-dimensional PTI induced by the phase transition of deliberately designed nanopatterns of a phase change material, Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 (GST), which indicates the first observation of the photonic topological phase transition in two-dimensional PTI with changes in the Chern number. This approach allows us to directly alter the topological invariants, which is achieved by symmetry-breaking perturbation through GST nanopatterns with different symmetry from original PTI. The success of our scheme is attributed to the ultrafine lithographic alignment technologies of GST nanopatterns. These results demonstrate how to control photonic topological properties in a reconfigurable manner, providing insight into the possibilities for reconfigurable photonic processing circuits.",

          "abstract": "Vortices are topologically distinctive objects appearing as phase twists in coherent fields of optical beams and Bose-Einstein condensates. Structured networks and artificial lattices of coupled vortices could offer a powerful platform to study and simulate interaction mechanisms between constituents of condensed matter systems, such as antiferromagnetic interactions, by replacement of spin angular momentum with orbital angular momentum. Here, we realize such a platform using a macroscopic quantum fluid of light based on exciton-polariton condensates. We imprint all-optical hexagonal lattice that results into a triangular vortex lattice, with each cell having a vortex of charge l = ±1. We reveal that pairs of coupled condensates spontaneously arrange their orbital angular momentum antiparallel, implying a form of artificial orbital “antiferromagnetism.” We discover that correlation exists between the emergent vortex patterns in triangular condensate lattices and the low-energy solutions of the corresponding antiferromagnetic Ising system. Our study offers a path toward spontaneously ordered vortex arrays with nearly arbitrary configurations and controlled couplings.",

          "abstract": "Consumption of a diet rich in saturated fat increases lipid absorption from the intestine, assembly into chylomicrons, and delivery to metabolic tissues via the lymphatic and circulatory systems. Accumulation of ceramide lipids, composed of sphingosine and a fatty acid, in metabolic tissues contributes to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cancer. Using a mesenteric lymph duct cannulated rat model, we showed that ceramides are generated by the intestine and assembled into chylomicrons, which are transported via the mesenteric lymphatic system. A lipidomic screen of intestinal-derived chylomicrons identified a diverse range of fatty acid, sphingolipid, and glycerolipid species that have not been previously detected in chylomicrons, including the metabolically deleterious C 16:0 ceramide that increased in response to high-fat feeding in rats and human high-lipid meal replacement enteral feeding. In conclusion, high-fat feeding increases the export of intestinal-derived C 16:0 ceramide in chylomicrons, identifying a potentially unknown mechanism through which ceramides are transported systemically to contribute to metabolic dysfunction.",

          "abstract": "Agonistic antibodies against CD137 have been demonstrated to completely regress established tumors through activating T cell immunity. Unfortunately, current CD137 antibodies failed to benefit patients with cancer. Moreover, their antitumor mechanisms in vivo remain to be determined. Here, we report the development of a small molecular CD137 agonist, JNU-0921. JNU-0921 effectively activates both human and mouse CD137 through direct binding their extracellular domains to induce oligomerization and signaling and effectively shrinks tumors in vivo. Mechanistically, JNU-0921 enhances effector and memory function of cytotoxic CD8 + T cells (CTLs) and alleviates their exhaustion. JNU-0921 also skews polarization of helper T cells toward T helper 1 type and enhances their activity to boost CTL function. Meanwhile, JNU-0921 attenuates the inhibitory function of regulatory T cells on CTLs. Our current work shows that JNU-0921 shrinks tumors by enhancing the cytotoxicity of CTLs in cis and in trans and sheds light on strategy for developing CD137 small molecular agonists.",

          "abstract": "High-grade glioma (HGG) is an aggressive brain tumor. Sex is an important factor that differentially affects survival outcomes in HGG. We used an end-to-end deep learning approach on hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) scans to (i) identify sex-specific histopathological attributes of the tumor microenvironment (TME), and (ii) create sex-specific risk profiles to prognosticate overall survival. Surgically resected H&amp;E-stained tissue slides were analyzed in a two-stage approach using ResNet18 deep learning models, first, to segment the viable tumor regions and second, to build sex-specific prognostic models for prediction of overall survival. Our mResNet-Cox model yielded C-index (0.696, 0.736, 0.731, and 0.729) for the female cohort and C-index (0.729, 0.738, 0.724, and 0.696) for the male cohort across training and three independent validation cohorts, respectively. End-to-end deep learning approaches using routine H&amp;E-stained slides, trained separately on male and female patients with HGG, may allow for identifying sex-specific histopathological attributes of the TME associated with survival and, ultimately, build patient-centric prognostic risk assessment models.",
